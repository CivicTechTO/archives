#### Digital pathway - Room 313

The Ontario [Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-advanced-education-and-skills-development) (MAESD) has a great deal of employment and education data, but needs your help to re-imagine it for public use! MAESD wants to create a tool that would help students better understand the educational pathway options available and the corresponding linkages to required occupational skills and labour market demand. In addition, gaining insight on the student educational experience and program outcomes across Ontario will allow students to make informed decisions and expand their choices.

#### Traffic dashboard - Room 306

The City of Toronto’s [Transportation Big Data Innovation Team](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=f98b551ed95ff410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) is looking for an interactive dashboard to tell the story of traffic speeds in Toronto. We’re providing access to historical and real-time traffic speeds on City-controlled highways and some major streets in the downtown core. You can combine this with open data that can help explain variations in traffic speeds such as weather or special events.

#### Landlord and tenant platform - Room 305

The [Landlord and Tenant Board of Ontario](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/) is looking for a simple, easy to navigate platform that allows the parties (the landlord or tenant) to communicate with each other, to upload documents or share materials needed in the file, and to allow for mediator-supported resolution through the tool.

#### Youth wellbeing data-dashboard - Room 312

How are young people doing in Ontario? Has youth wellbeing changed over time? What youth outcomes should be prioritized?

Help the [Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services](http://ontario.ca/mcys) (MCYS) create a data-dashboard of youth wellbeing! Collecting data on how young people are doing is only half the battle - this information must be presented in a way that is **useful** and **attractive** to service providers, policy makers in government and community leaders. To be truly effective, this data dashboard must bring together key datasets including the Youth Crime Rate and Youth Unemployment Rate with a customized look and feel. Designers - come meet some data experts. Data experts - let’s give the attention your work deserves by elevating our design game.

#### Dream 2030 - Room 313

What could Ontario’s postsecondary system look like in 2030? How can universities, colleges, and the government prepare for the future of postsecondary education (PSE)? Demographics, migration, technology and globalization will impact our systems, and the PSE system must evolve to reflect the rapidly changing needs of students, employers and the workforce.

This strategic foresight exercise will emphasize Blue Sky thinking, and help the Ontario [Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-advanced-education-and-skills-development) form its research agenda to prepare for big trends and potential disruptions. Come help us prepare for a future full of surprises and opportunities!

#### Ontario.ca Analytics - Room 325

Ontario.ca is Ontario’s main website for government information. The site is user focused, using analytics, focus groups and user-testing to make it useful and understandable.

Access to analytics data is currently limited, but this need not be the case. The province will give participants a sneak peek at the data, which is currently in the open data process. Participants are challenged to both:

- Investigate the data and report their insights
- Build on the open source 18F code to create a user-friendly front-end to the data

Data will be provided in the format used by analytics.usa.gov.

#### Prioritizing Data - Room 327

Ontario has published a list of its data on ontario.ca. Ministries are now prioritizing their data to identify which to publish first.

This is the first time the province has published a list of its datasets, and we’d like your help to put it to use. Challengers are invited to build on the inventory and help focus efforts by providing:

- Insights, such as looking through the list and identifying datasets as high-value against criteria important to you
- Solutions, such as an online space where the public could comment or vote on datasets

#### Personal Health Record - Room 325

Patients are very commonly asked for their immunization history and what medications they’re taking. For many patients, these questions are difficult to answer accurately and comprehensively. This challenge is to make an app/tool that accesses patients’ records, and makes it very simple for them to provide complete answers to these questions.
