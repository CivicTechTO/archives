Building on the success of [Civic Tech Toronto’s first user research 101 workshop](https://civictech.ca/2016/04/08/user-research-way-towards-insight-and-success/), we are thrilled to invite you to join us at the next User Research 101 Workshop, presented by [Urban+Digital](http://urbandigital.ca/).

This is a hands-on workshop for anyone with limited or no design-based [user research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Research)experience to gain a basic understanding of what it is, why it is important and how to apply it to civic tech and other projects.

You’ll walk away from this workshop knowing how to:

- Gather and translate user insights to create projects communities will actually use
- Apply a key user research methodology
- Improve your design skill set with an understanding of the human-centered design process, and
- Explore real needs and lived experiences to get at the root problems you want to help address

Who is it for:

- People who are interested or curious but have little to no experience in user research or design methodologies
- People working in the areas of design, technology, government and nonprofits who want to gain a deeper and more holistic understanding of their audiences
- Individuals excited about civic problems who want to design better solutions to fit user and community needs

Don’t delay – spots are limited so register today. For tickets and more information, visit our Eventbrite registration page below.
