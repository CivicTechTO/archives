**Civic Spark is coming to Toronto this August 16–17 — a two-day gathering for people building the future of public life. What makes it special? It’s entirely volunteer-organized.**  

From curating speakers to designing the website, coordinating logistics, and shaping the event’s values — Civic Spark is being built by a crew of civic technologists, community organizers, and first-time contributors. All working together to create a space that’s honest, inclusive, and grounded in real work.

We believe change happens when people connect across sectors and silos — and this gathering is a reflection of that.

We’re grateful to our organizing partners — the Centre for Analytics & Artificial Intelligence Engineering and 1RG — for supporting us throughout the journey. And to our presenting sponsors — the City of Toronto’s Open Data team and *The Toronto Star* — for helping bring the vision to life.

We hope you’ll join us for grounded talks from seasoned doers, and co-created sessions unpacking today’s opportunities and challenges.

You're invited.

*Share your story. Spark connection. Shape what’s next.*
