## Challenges

**We'll be adding more challenges here in the lead-up to the event. Challenges are subject to change; we expect to have about 8 for participants to choose from.**

- [The Action Group on Access to Justice](http://theactiongroup.ca/) wants to create a _widget_, which law firms and community organizations (or others) could install on their website to offer their visitors access to accurate, reliable public legal education (PLE) materials on a range of legal topics (employee rights, separation/divorce, tenant rights, etc.) in multiple languages. PLE materials in languages besides English and French can be hard to find, and are often poorly translated. The database of approved online PLE materials already exists; a widget would allow many websites to leverage these databases to present those approved materials to those who need them.
- The [City of Toronto’s open data](http://toronto.ca/open) team wants your help to _analyze how people use the open data portal_. What are the patterns and trends? How much does it change from week to week? This data hasn’t been leveraged before, and it’s a great opportunity to contribute to making Toronto’s open data portal better for everyone.
- [Rexdale Lab](https://rexdalelab.wordpress.com/) wants to set up more Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs), so that property developers hire more local residents when they’re doing major construction projects. They want your help to identify and map planning major construction projects across the city, to identify opportunities to create jobs and provide economic value for the neighbourhoods that need it most.
- [The Mississauga Halton Health Integration Network](http://www.mississaugahaltonlhin.on.ca/) (LHIN) wants to build a website which makes it easy for people to find specific health and support services that suits them. For example: to find a female doctor, who speaks Urdu, who is accepting new patients, and whose office is easy to get to on transit. We’ll tackle the first steps at CodeAcross: identifying data sources, and mapping out the architecture of the system and the process for developing it.
- The [Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page11.aspx) wants your help -- use your UI skills to design better data collection forms that social service organizations use to input data about their programs. In the past, forms with weak UI have resulted in low-quality being collected. Better forms will mean better data, and better data will help lead to better affordable housing policy in Ontario.
- [David Hains](https://twitter.com/davidhains) of [Torontoist](http://torontoist.com/) wants to build a Toronto version of [Councilmatic](https://www.councilmatic.org/), a modern open-source platform where citizens can easily navigate, learn, discover and share what city hall is up to -- legislation introduced and passed, the various committees and the meetings they hold, and the councillors themselves.
- The Ontario [Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS)](http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/index.aspx) has lots of data, but needs your help to make better sense of it. We use data to inform policy decisions, but often these datasets relate to different geographic units. MCYS wants to create a map that allows 'toggling' between several geographic boundaries. This will lay the foundation for correlations between outcomes for youth in Ontario, including youth crime, education, and mental health and additions.
- [Project Neutral](http://projectneutral.org/) needs help user testing and designing a data-rigorous carbon footprinting calculator, that compares your footprint to your neighbourhood’s. How can we make a complex calculation simple and fun? How can we ensure the tool is broadly accessible? How we promote awareness during the process? Come help contribute towards reducing Toronto’s carbon footprint.
