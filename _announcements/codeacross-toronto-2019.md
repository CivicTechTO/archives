## About CodeAcross 2019

This year’s CodeAcross will focus on building community resilience for the long-term. How do we help each other make good judgment? How do we build on what we already have? How do we move from some building solutions “for” others to “us” building solutions for ourselves?

Just as importantly, the event will be designed to reflect these questions. As a community, we wish to move away from an unnecessary focus on quick fixes and competitive prizes. Technology is not an end solution, but a means to an end. We plan for an event which can help participants of all backgrounds reach a common understanding on the human depth and breadth of our community challenges as the basis for the solutions we build.

The event will be accessible and youth-friendly. We intend for the hackathon to be a pop-up public process incubator: to seed connections for collaborators to continue building long after the event is done.
