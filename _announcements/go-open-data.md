## About GO Open Data 2019

The 2019 GO Open Data conference will be held in Toronto, hosted by the Toronto Reference Library. Go Open Data is an annual conference that is attended by all sectors interested in learning about and promoting the creation and use of open data.

By definition, open data is machine-readable data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike.

But what open data can do is far more important. Open data means transparency and efficiency in government. It means developers can use open data to create innovative solutions and new businesses that help address community problems such as transportation or affordable housing. It means more engaged citizens, bringing together public and private organizations and bridging gaps.

Open data is disruptive. It has the potential to create a better future for everyone. It’s about creating dialogue, creating innovative technologies and highlighting the real business needs for open data.
