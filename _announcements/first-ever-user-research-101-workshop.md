We are hosting a free, hands-on workshop for anyone with limited or no design-based user research experience to gain a basic understanding of what it is, why it is important and how to apply it to projects.

What will you learn:

- Gather and translate user insights to create projects that communities will love
- Apply a key user research methodology
- Improve your design skill set with an understanding of the human-centered design process
- And understand how to explore real needs and lived experiences to get at the root problems you’re solving for

Who is it for:

- People who are interested or curious but have little or no experience in user research or design methodologies
- People in the field of design, technology, government and non-profits who want to gain a deeper and more holistic understanding of their audiences
- Individuals excited about civic problems who want to better design them to fit user & community needs

For those interested in applying their learnings after the workshop, there will be also an (optional) opportunity to gain practical insights on user research through participating in the user-research phase of a real life Civic Tech Toronto project!
