1. Challenge intro

The Youth Employment Challenge is our first time collaborating directly with a government agency, and the first time we’re able to offer financial incentives (totaling $3,000!) for members of the community to work on civic tech projects.

As an experiment in both of these respects, this challenge is designed to _enable learning_. The focus is on process, and the challenge is _non-competitive_. Every team that meets the criteria listed below will share in the cash award.

## 2. Context and question

Youth employment in Canada is undergoing a period of change, with people entering the full time workforce later and at a more gradual rate than they were a generation ago. Government officials are working to understand the implication of this trend. There are some trends in youth employment that may contribute to negative outcomes for Canadian youth in the workforce, including:

- Lack of workforce preparedness, especially with respect to “soft skills”. 
- Mismatch of educational choices with labour market needs.
- Lack of relevant work experience, and impacts of unpaid internships.

Furthermore, data shows that certain groups are at a higher risk of un- and underemployment:

- Indigenous youth
- Racialized and newcomer youth
- Youth living in poverty or in conflict with the law
- Youth in and leaving care
- LGBTQ youth
- Youth with disabilities and special needs

The Youth Employment Challenge asks you to develop and test a prototype answer the following question:

**How might civic technology contribute to improving youth employment in Canada?**

Improved youth employment may mean:

- Youth getting jobs
- Job readiness/employability
- Knowledge of the job market
- Ability to make more informed education decisions
- Many other things!

Design for youth as you see it. Typically, governments and social service providers consider “youth” to include people between 15 and 29 years old. You might choose to focus on a more specific group of youth
