title: ClimateFast
description: ClimateFast is volunteer-based community organization dedicated to building strong, informed public pressure to take urgent, substantial, and just action on the climate crisis. The organization consists of people with different degrees of experience in climate activism and advocates to progress municipal climate policies across all three levels of government. The group meets bi-weekly and has multiple working groups or sub-groups called “committees”. The development and maintenance of the Climate Voting Records Toronto website is currently run by a committee within ClimateFast. The voting records project was made possible because it had resources, connections, and support from Toronto’s climate community.
