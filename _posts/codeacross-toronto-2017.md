This year’s [CodeAcross](https://civictech.ca/codeacross-toronto-2017/) was truly something special. The eager crowd worked on eight challenges brought to us by key government departments, including the Ontario Ministry of Health, the Landlord and Tenant Board, and the City of Toronto’s Transportation Big Data Innovation Team. The opportunity to collaborate on these major civic projects allowed for teams to make a meaningful and lasting impact on real policy challenges.

The [iSchool](http://ischool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto was a perfect setting for a hackathon. We felt right at home preparing for our Open Data Day festivities. Our volunteers worked tirelessly to ensure everything came together, leading to a seamless day of thought leadership and civic scheming. We would like to extend a special thank-you to everyone involved, as well as our generous partners and sponsors: [Randstad Technologies](https://www.randstad.ca/), [Urban+Digital](http://www.urbandigital.ca/), [City of Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=8e79f9be8db1c310VgnVCM1000006cd60f89RCRD), [Province of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/), and [Open Data Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9e56e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD).

We captured the magic in this Storify, enjoy!

For our second annual CodeAcross, and fifth celebration of International Open Data Day, we brought together the CivicTechTO community to tackle unique challenges from major government partners.
