We strongly encourage you to come to the challenge launch on October 18, but if you can’t make it that evening, all challenge materials will also be posted online the following day.

Like all our activities, the Youth Employment Challenge is open to participants with any background or technical skill level. Please join us! RSVP here: [http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/events/234590039/](http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/events/234590039/)

The Youth Employment Challenge is sponsored by the federal government. We’re thrilled that government agencies see the value in the work happening at Civic Tech Toronto hacknights, and we’re happy to be joining the ranks of community groups like [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org/) and [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/) who have developed collaborative relationships with government agencies.
