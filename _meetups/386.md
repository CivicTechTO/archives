Topic: **Talking Taxes: Advising Canadians about free tax filing**

TaxGPT is a AI-lite friendly chatbot that gives Canadians advice on how to file their taxes for free. Taxes are complex, and one of the main use cases of AI is condensing longform text into easily understood summaries — sounds like a win-win! Well, almost. This talk covers the herky-jerky development of a ChatGPT-backed chatbot: what it's good at, and what to watch out for.

Speaker: **Paul Craig**

Paul Craig is a web developer currently living in Ottawa. He's worked for the UK government and the Canadian federal government, and is big into building websites with no business model. Follow Paul on Twitter: [@pcraig3](https://twitter.com/pcraig3).
