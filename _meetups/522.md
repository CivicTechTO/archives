topic: Civic Dashboard – Project Update!
description: |-
  civicdashboard.ca is a 100% volunteer-run effort to make understanding and engaging with Toronto's City Council take only a few minutes for anyone!

  You can learn how Council works, see your Councillor's voting record, get alerts for topics you care about, take meaningful action with 1 click, and more.

  In keeping with our commitment to full openness, this presentation is a project update for the community! The team will talk about:
  - what they've been up to for the last 6 months
  - what they've learned
  - what's next, and how anyone (including you!) can get involved

  The team behind civicdashboard.ca will be speaking - passionate volunteers working to make Toronto's democracy accessible to all!
