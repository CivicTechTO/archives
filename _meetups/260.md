topic: Re-imagining a Future for Political Participation
description: |-
  The COVID19 pandemic has changed our lives drastically, making us acutely aware of both gaps and opportunities that can transform policy and systems that affect us. Join us 25, September, 2020 for an interactive discussion on what the pandemic experience reveals about the future of civic responsibility and political participation.

  Facilitated by the future Lab, on behalf of the Institute of the Future, findings of this discussion will feed in to the Imaginable Project. The Imaginable Project is working across more than 50 countries to spark public conversations about our post-pandemic, post-protest future across the Internet.
