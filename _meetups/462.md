topic: Bringing Complaints Online at the City of Toronto
description: Have you ever had an issue with the City and wanted to submit a complaint? Previously, each of the City’s internal divisions had their own process, making it difficult to navigate. This Complaints & Compliments project is the foundational step towards unification. We will share with you some ups and downs from this project implementation and do a few interactive sessions on things to come.
