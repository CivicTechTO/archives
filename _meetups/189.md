  Jocelyn will be talking about her experience coming to development through a non-traditional background, growing through the Bridge Program, and the lessons learned in eventually becoming a Bridge instructor herself.

  Bridge is a federally-incorporated not-for-profit organization that brings together people who believe that we can and should remove barriers preventing members of marginalized groups from participating fully and equally in the technology industry.
