topic: Ontario's Digital Government Agenda
description: |-
  Andre Cote (SPPG '09 grad) and Grahame Rivers will be talking to the group about Ontario's Digital Government agenda – and the role civic tech can play in it.

  Digital government is about simpler, faster, better public services. Using the power of the internet, modern technology and service design, it's about improving the online experience for citizens and transforming government services – whether it's ordering a vehicle permit, applying for student aid or finding a health service near home.

  'Cause isn't that what people deserve? And what public service should be about?
