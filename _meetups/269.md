topic: Reusing e-waste to increase access to technology
description: |-
  Free Geek Toronto is a technology reuse not-for-profit organization that uses unwanted electronics to increase access to technology, offer employment and training opportunities, and reduce the environmental impact of technology.
  As an active advocate for the circular economy, Free Geek is doing its utmost to help minimize negative impacts on the environment. We focus on reuse as it decreases the amount of waste created while also giving access to technology for those who were previously unavailable at an affordable cost. Access to hardware, along with connectivity, is the first step to creating a digitally inclusive society, where technology is demystified.
