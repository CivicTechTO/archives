topic: "Human Cartography: Emerging Methods and Metaphors of Polis-like Tools"
description: Challenging cultural conversations are often terrifying and emotionally fraught because they reveal how varied people's beliefs can be—but what if we could create shared maps of human perspectives? Patcon will share a Google Maps-inspired tool he's built on top of Polis' agree/disagree data, revealing ways that people can come together despite all their complexities and contradictions—making our differences a little less terrifying.
