Hosts: the Brookfield Institute (http://brookfieldinstitute.ca/) for Innovation + Entrepreneurship

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)

The venue is fully accessible, with elevators available from street-level. Note: only the elevators at the 20 Dundas West entrance (on Dundas St) go to the correct 9th floor.

Attendance will be capped at 60 people. Please RSVP and arrive on time! Doors will be closed once we reach 60 people. For more info, visit civictech.ca. Here's our Code of Conduct: civictech.ca/about-us

This will be our last hacknight of 2017, see you all in 2018!!
