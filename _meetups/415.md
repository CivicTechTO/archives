For October 2023, Civic Tech Toronto is focusing on housing. We've invited technologists, advocates, journalists and public servants to share their perspectives on one of Toronto's most pressing issues.

On Oct. 17, we'll be joined by Geordie Dent of the [Federation of Metro Tenants' Associations](https://www.torontotenants.org/). The FMTA has been educating, organizing and advocating for tenants in the city since 1974. Geordie will discuss their efforts to identify landlords, track evictions and more.
