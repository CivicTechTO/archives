title: "Meetup #531 Daniel Liadsky – A Happy Accident: Toronto Drop-in Recreation Finder"
date: 2026-02-24
topic: "A Happy Accident: Toronto Drop-in Recreation Finder"
description: "recfinderto.ca started as a workplace experiment: a practical way to explore how AI‑assisted coding tools could support real development workflows. In this talk, Daniel Liadsky shares how experimenting with AI tools without a roadmap led to rapid prototyping and a deeper understanding of where they genuinely accelerate work (and where they don’t). It’s a behind‑the‑scenes look at adopting AI in a real‑world context and how a simple hands‑on trial turned into something genuinely useful."
