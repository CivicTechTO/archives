title: "Hacknight #265 – maplesync: the futures of economic coordination"
description: How might we inclusively coordinate, allocate, and plan our economies for mutual prosperity through collective intelligence? Project Maplesync is a platform initiative, inspired by the field of cybernetics, to form indicative plans and other information integration functions at different economic scales and contexts. Maplesync is in its early stages as an open-source project to inspire new thinking on this topic and to generate new experiments in the field, and we are looking for collaborators!
