topic: PayIt – City of Toronto's Innovative Digital Transformation or an Accountability Failure?
description: |-
  This session will dive deep into the case of PayIT, a technology procurement at the City of Toronto that sowed controversy from the outset and ended in an Auditor General's review and premature end to the contract.

  Sonali Chakraborti, a seasoned municipal public servant, has written up a award winning teaching case on the topic, that public servants and interested civic leaders can learn from.
