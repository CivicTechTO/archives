topic: Crowdsorsa – a mobile game to engage your citizens!
description: |-
  Katja Boutou introduces Crowdsorsa – an innovative platform that uses gamification and crowdsourcing to tackle environmental and infrastructure challenges.
  Cities have plenty of built and natural environment to look after.
  What many of them don’t have is enough data and resources to do it on time – when the costs and consequences are at their lowest.
  Luckily there are hundreds, even thousands of people ready to help: the citizens!
  Crowdsorsa mobile game, an innovation from Finland, lets people participate in improving their environment through fun and rewarding missions tailored to cities’ needs.
  Citizens can collect road condition data, map manhole covers or destroy sightings of invasive plant species. The ways to engage them are endless.
