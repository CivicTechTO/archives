topic: Emerging Digital and Urban Technologies in Forestry
description: The management of urban natural capital is often challenging. In many cities, practitioners are struggling to make informed and strategic decisions about urban forests and green infrastructure in the face of constrained budgets, limited capacity and resources, conflicting priorities, and, importantly, environmental change. To this end, data-driven decision making and planning will be increasingly recognized a crucial component of urban forest management. We discuss how emerging digital and urban technologies can help urban foresters make better decisions about the trees under their care in the face of environmental change. We also discuss opportunities for open and big data to understand and assess citizen requests about urban trees, and hypothesize about the growing role of technology in supporting citizen science and promoting tree stewardship.
