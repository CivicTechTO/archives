Topic: **Would zero-occupant automated vehicles impact Toronto's mobility?**

The advent of autonomous vehicles would change cities' economic, social, and mobility landscapes. Based on a stakeholder engagement and a literature review, this presentation explores the potential issues associated with Zero Occupant Vehicles (ZOVs). As this is an ongoing research project, the presentation would also serve as a platform to share your thought on ZOV impacts.

_For the month of November 2022, Civic Tech Toronto is focusing on the theme of transportation. We've invited technologists, advocates, journalists and public servants to share their perspectives on what it's like to move through Canada's largest city._

Speakers:

- **Lisa L. Losada-Rojas** is a Postdoctoral fellow working at the Mobility Network at the University of Toronto. Her research interests include transportation planning, accessibility, active travel, public health, transportation modelling and forecasting, rural transportation, and sustainability.
