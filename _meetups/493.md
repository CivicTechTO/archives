topic: "AI for Tenants: Flagging Illegal Lease Clauses Before You Sign"
description: |-
  Tired of seeing family and friends fall into rental traps, Henry built an AI tool (readmylease.ca) to help renters during the offer stage, when landlords often slip in questionable terms on Form 400 or the Ontario Standard Lease. An AI instantly flags illegal clauses and hidden red flags, giving tenants the clarity and confidence they need before signing.
  Hear about how he did it, and what this means for renters!
