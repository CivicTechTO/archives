Topic:

This is our last Hacknight for 2020! Join us for some social activities and a moment to reflect on all that we've done in the last year—it was a big one, but the clouds are parting and 2021 is on the horizon.

- Agenda:

7:00-7:20 = Welcome and Introductions
7:20-7:50 = Social Activities (TBA)
7:50-9:00 = Breakout groups (go make something!)
9:00 = Civic Tech Toronto Virtual Hang Out
