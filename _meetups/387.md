Topic: **What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong about the Future of Transportation**

Silicon Valley made a lot of big promises for how it was going to improve mobility with big ideas like self-driving cars, flying vehicles, Hyperloops, and more. But more than a decade since they started promoting their ideas, they haven’t been able to deliver, and it’s become clearer than ever that relying on tech companies won’t address the problems in our transport system. Paris Marx will break down the problems with Silicon Valley’s approach and what we need to do to really tackle our mobility challenges.
