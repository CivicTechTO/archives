**Topic: What's going on with GenAI?**
Generative AI and large language models are widely talked about, but often not that well understood. Alex will talk through some of the key developments in this area in the last year, particularly focusing on some of the ethical, moral and economic implications that we've seen.

**Speaker:** Alex Olson is a senior research associate at the University of Toronto's Centre for Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering. He considers himself an AI-skeptic AI researcher.

**Join us in person**:

- We're meeting at UofT's Myhal Centre, at 55 St George Street. We'll be in room 380. There will be signs!
