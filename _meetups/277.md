topic: "me-dérive: toronto — Participatory Archiving x AR"
description: "me-dérive: toronto is a research-creation project by Dr. Ana Rita Morais that explores the intersections between between participatory archiving and augmented reality (AR), rooted in the necessity to engage more fully with Toronto's historical and diverse cultural heritage. It is the first AR visual archive of Toronto's diverse historical narratives that mobilizes archival power away from the institution and into the hands of the public, coding found and crowdsourced records onto their site-specific locations."
