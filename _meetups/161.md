  Every day, we ‘like’ posts on social media, check apps to see when the next bus is coming, tap our credit cards, walk past security cameras… and the river of information generated and stored about us swells. This data may be about me, but whose is it, really? What control over it and its use do I have? The Whose Data project aims to make it easier for Canadians to answer these questions.
