topic: Designing Against Domestic Violence
description: As technology continues to become more and more embedded in our lives, technology-facilitated domestic abuse has grown as a problem. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims, meaning that technologists have a responsibility to ensure that users of our products are empowered to protect their safety. This talk will provide the audience with a framework for considering safety in the process of design and building technology.
