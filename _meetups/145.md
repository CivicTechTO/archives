description: |-
  In Toronto a pedestrian is seriously injured or killed every 3 days on our roads. The Vision Zero Challenge is an 8-week competition where participants will work in teams or independently to develop innovative and data driven solutions to make Toronto's streets safer for everyone today and into the future.

  The teams with the most promising solutions will be awarded cash prizes and the opportunity to receive coaching and training at Civic Hall Toronto to further develop their idea side by side with City of Toronto staff.

  The Vision Zero Challenge is powered by the City of Toronto and the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship.
