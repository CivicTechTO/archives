Come help us chip away at civic challenges! We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to contribute towards, and pizza (or other noms) to snack on!

@brankamarijan @ploughshares_ca @BanKillerRobots

- Biographies:

Branka leads the research on the military and security implications of emerging technologies. Her work examines ethical concerns regarding the development of autonomous weapons systems and the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on security provision and trends in warfare. She holds a PhD from the Balsillie School of International Affairs with a specialization in conflict and security. She has conducted research on post-conflict societies and published academic articles and reports on the impacts of conflict on civilians and diverse issues of security governance, including security sector reform.

- Venue sponsor:

Kindred.ai are our wonderful venue and food sponsor for the month of July! https://www.kindred.ai/

Kindred Systems are building artificial intelligent robots for complex unstructured environments, like eCommerce and retail supply chains.

- Check-in details:

If you arrive and nobody is there to let you in, please press the white button on the call box, in front of the door with the "Kindred" logo.

If you run into any issues, then please send a message to our "doorbell" at 647-812-2649 (647-8122-6IX), and the organizers will get a notification.

- Accessibility:

The venue is accessible! There is a long ramp at the front of the building, which leads down to the main door. Please enter the building via the north-east ramp.

We can offer 2 transit tokens per participant per week to those in need of transportation support to get to hacknights. Please ask an organizer to take advantage of this. (We have a set budget for tokens, and if we’re running low, we will make every attempt to update the event description to say so.)

- About us:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

- Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
