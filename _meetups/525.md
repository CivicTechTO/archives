title: "Hacknight #525 Frédéric Julien – Artsdata: Open Data Infrastructure for the Performing Arts"
date: 2026-01-13
topic: "Artsdata: Open Data Infrastructure for the Performing Arts"
description: Live performance information is ephemeral and is dispersed across thousands of websites and platforms. This makes it difficult for search engines for Large Language Models to decipher what is worthy of being served as an answer, when an arts goer asks them “what’s on this weekend?”. The Artsdata knowledge graph was designed to overcome these information gaps (and many others).
