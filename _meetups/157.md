This hacknight will be a project night. No speaker this week, just lots of time for project work!

\*\*\* THIS MONTH'S VENUE SPONSOR:

Sidewalk Labs

Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that imagines, designs, tests, and builds urban innovations to help cities meet their biggest challenges. They are designing a district in Toronto’s Eastern Waterfront to tackle the challenges of urban growth, working in partnership with the tri-government agency Waterfront Toronto and the local community. This joint effort, called Sidewalk Toronto, aims to make Toronto the global hub for urban innovation.
