description: Civic Tech Toronto's very own Law & Design CoLab are a team of volunteers that works to bring more design thinking and cross-sector collaboration to Ontario's justice sector. The team conceives, scopes, and runs projects in partnership with people and organizations who are working to improve access to justice in Ontario. Tonight we're excited to be getting an update on the wrap-up of their very first project, and a preview of what they're up to next!
