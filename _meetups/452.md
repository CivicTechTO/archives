**Topic:** Grocery Tracker: Leveraging Data for Food Transparency in Toronto

**Speaker:** Eric Wickham

Eric Wickham is a journalist in Toronto working on the Grocery Tracker, a data driven reporting project for The Hoser in partnership with Northwestern University. The Grocery Tracker collects data on food staples in stores across the city, and has recently expanded to accept community data submissions for local, independent stores.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at UofT's Myhal Centre, at 55 St George Street. We'll be in room 380. There will be signs!
