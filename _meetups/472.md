description: This presentation introduces a powerful Multilingual Climate Chatbot, designed to bridge the gap in climate education for all Torontonians, especially youth and marginalized communities. Built on advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, this chatbot uses fine-tuned embedding models and hybrid search to cut through the disjointed, jargon-heavy climate information that currently limits engagement and creates barriers.
