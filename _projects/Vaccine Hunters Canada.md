## Summary

Vaccine Hunters Canada was founded on March 19, 2021 by Andrew Young, who was inspired by the US site VaccineHunter.org while trying to book vaccinations for his own parents in Ontario. What started as a single person buying a domain name and setting up a Discord server grew into a 100-person volunteer operation helping Canadians across the country find COVID-19 vaccine appointments.

At its peak, the community had over 427,000 followers across Twitter, Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Their self-serve tool, Find Your Immunization (appointments.vaccinehunters.ca), had over 2 million unique users. The organization accepted no donations and had no government, public health, or corporate affiliations.

Exactly one year after launching, on March 19, 2022, Vaccine Hunters Canada quietly closed its doors, noting that vaccines were now readily available across Canada and that millions of Canadians had been fully vaccinated.
