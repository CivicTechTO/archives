Canadian SaaS is an open-source project that enables Canadians to discover Canadian software while also increasing transparency around how data is stored, processed, and tracked.

Our mission:

- Support the Canadian software industry by listing homegrown companies Canadians can use and build careers with.
- Map the dependencies behind Canadian digital services so Canadians can better understand sovereignty risks and data privacy implications.
