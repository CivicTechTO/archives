We’re building an open platform where anyone can document and understand how organizations work — from a small community group to a city government.

Our goal is to bring clarity and transparency to structure, finances, laws, and decision-making, so members can participate more effectively and the public can easily see how things are working.

Think of it as a SimCity-style tool for governance, with core modules for elections, finance, and community decision-making.

We’re early in the journey and open to feedback. If you’re interested in civic tech, government operations, or community-driven systems, let’s connect.
