TaxGPT generates answers based on publicly information from the Canada Revenue Agency website. It uses the ChatGPT’s AI model to return information about Canada’s tax system, and is intended for a beginner audience. The intent is to provide a friendly and approachable way to start learning about taxes, not to solve for complex scenarios.
