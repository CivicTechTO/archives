description: Our vision for The Carded is to provide user-friendly resources for youth and people affected by racial profiling. We welcome collaboration with people from all walks of life, whether you're a parent, teacher, frontline worker, activist, psychologist, artist, designer, journalist or civic professional. We hope to connect you with other concerned citizens and organizations that have crucial information on “carding”.
