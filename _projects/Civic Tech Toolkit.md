The Civic Tech Toolkit is an initiative out of Civic Tech Toronto to equip contributors with patterns and mindsets to drive impact collaboratively.

At first we made a website, but realizing that this was too long of a journey for those we meet in person we shifted the content into a tight physical form that we could put in people's hands: ⭐️ zines ⭐️.

You can get the community edition of the Civic Tech Toolkit Zines for your own customization on Figma at: [figma community file: 1597316383636313466](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1597316383636313466)

If you just want the PDFs you can get the latest by visiting our [slack channel](https://civictechto.slack.com/archives/C0739GZADL6).

You can also join the team to become an editor of the source file or provide feedback by joining us on slack.
