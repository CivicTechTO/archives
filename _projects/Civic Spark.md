Civic Spark is a gathering for people who care about the future of public life.

We bring together organizers, technologists, public servants, mutual aid networks, researchers, designers, and community leaders from across North America.

Creating a space to share real stories, challenge assumptions, and explore what works — and what doesn’t — when building for civic impact.
