Meshnets are highly distributed, redundant intranet networks. A series of nodes, usually fashioned from cannibalized routers, emit signals that create a free self-contained and self-reliant network that’s accessible to any internet capable devices within range. We are dedicated to the growth of free-to-use wireless Internet access in Toronto’s public and publicly accessible spaces.
