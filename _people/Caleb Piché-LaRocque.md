description: My name is Caleb Piché-LaRocque, I was born and raised in Sudbury Ontario and I’ve lived here since. I am a 4th year student at Laurentian University doing a double-major in Business and Economics. Being a student in business it is not a surprise that I enjoy spending my time learning and teaching financial literacy. I am also very outgoing. Always looking to meet new people!
