description: Currently freelancing in Toronto, Iâ€™m an Italian visual designer with 4 years of experience in communication agencies. My background in law and my interest in human-centered design brought me to join the Law & Design CoLab, where I try to live the best of both worlds by working on projects promoting access to justice in Ontario.
