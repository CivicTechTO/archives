description: |-
  Cara Scarfone has spent her career working in the public service at the provincial and federal levels. A cheerleader for all things open government, she values the opportunity to engage with the public to find out what matters most to them.
  Cara thrives on collaboration and partnerships. The main word used to describe her is “enthusiastic” and she brings this enthusiasm to her work in open data and open government. Past files involve AI and the Open Government Partnership action plan, user research, and open data. She lives in Toronto with her many plants and enjoys old books and confetti cannons, but not at the same time.
