description: Keith is best known for his work as the first Open Data Lead with the CIty of Toronto. He was the first official blogger for the City and one of the first to use Social Media tools as an accepted part of government work. As Open Data Lead, his “unofficial Open Data National Anthem” — the Open Data Song — went viral and led to many diverse connections and relationships across the world. Connections Keith maintains to this day. In 2017, Keith was invited to speak at the International Open Data and Urban Innovation Summit in Shanghai, China. His impressions while there — and subsequent research on how fast and how far China is moving with technology — triggered an urgent passion to speak around the benefits and risks of Artificial Intelligence. In 2018, Keith founded literacyAI to house his efforts to curate, unpack, ponder and workshop the many layers around the topic. In 2019, Keith joined the GO Open Data Association as their Director of Communications keeping his hand in the Open Data arena.
