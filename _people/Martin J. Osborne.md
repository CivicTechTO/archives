description: Martin J. Osborne is a retired academic economist who has long dabbled in web development. He was involved in the founding of [EconJobMarket](https://econjobmarket.org), a platform that allows recruiters to advertise jobs and collect and process applications, and has been one of its two Chief Information Officers for several years. He was also one of the founders of the Open Access journal [Theoretical Economics](https://econtheory.org), serving as its Editor for the first nine years of its existence and working extensively on its editorial software system. For the last 15 years he has developed software for [text2bib.org](https://text2bib.org), a niche service that allows authors to convert files of references from plain text to BibTeX format. His [academic work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lx-4Hd8AAAAJ) is entirely theoretical, but ever since tracking the rise and fall of songs on the British Top 10 as a teenager, he has been interested in collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data. He has lived in the Bloor and Bathurst neighbourhood for the last 40 years.
