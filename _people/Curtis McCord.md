Past projects have included a deconstruction of Budget Talks, Ontario's digital pre-budgetary consultation, an examination of Sidewalk Toronto's engagement methods and project scope, as well as collaborations on critical approaches to requirements engineering. Curtis has been attending Civic Tech Toronto since 2015, and for the last year, has been volunteering at CTTO as part of his dissertation research.
