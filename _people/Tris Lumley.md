description: Tris is Director of Innovation & Development at NPC – a London-based think tank and consultancy working to help transform the social sector through the use of data, technology and evidence. Tris is working on developing pooled grant funds that focus on a particular thematic area (currently women’s empowerment and youth development), are built on collaboration between nonprofits and service providers, and bring in the technology sector to apply its skills and solutions to social issues and opportunities. At the heart of this model is user-centred research and design – mapping people’s pathways through their lived experience, and then mapping technology against those pathways. The aim of the model is to get funding to focus on real problems and solutions, driven by user insight, not organizational perspectives.
