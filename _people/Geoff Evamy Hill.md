  Geoff is a Master of Design student in the Strategic Foresight and Innovation program at OCAD University. He is a graduate of the Knowledge Integration program at the University Waterloo. His undergraduate thesis was about the economic calculation problem, focused on heuristics for pricing (https://gceh.ca/conference-paper/). This line of inquiry eventually evolved into the thinking behind maplesync.
  Prior to maplesync, Geoff founded the Canoe Joint-Canadian Undergraduate Programs project (https://canoejcup.ca/). His other interests include cognitive science, philosophy, computation, and futures. In his spare time, Geoff likes walking, grand strategy video games, making plastic models, and learning Spanish.
