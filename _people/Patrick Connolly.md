description: 'Patcon is a public servant and independent researcher of deliberative democracy. Beneath the surface, his interests include: structure and disorder in governance, complexity science, origins of life, operationalizing anarchy, the lines between individuals and collectives, small-world networks, the divinity of metaphor, and how non-verbal human intuition—curiosity, laughter, surprise, eeriness—orients us toward "livingness" in the universe.'
