description: Lex Harvey is the transportation reporter for the Toronto Star, where she writes about the ways in which Torontonians get around, and how that's changing with pandemic work/life shifts and the growing urgency of climate change. Before that, she covered politics and national news, and before THAT, she woke up bright and early at 4 a.m. for two years to write the Star's flagship morning newsletter, First Up. Outside of work, catch her running, knitting, or planning her next adventure.
