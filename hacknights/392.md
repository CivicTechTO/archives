Topic: **No More Noise Toronto!**

Right on the heels of [the No More Noise Toronto campaign being featured in Hot Docs](https://hotdocs.ca/whats-on/hot-docs-festival/films/2023/do-you-hear-what-i-hear), come and hear about what Citizen Science (you!) can do to reduce noise and improve the health of every person in earshot.

Speaker: **Ingrid Buday**

* Ingrid has a background in HR, IT and (is learning) GIS. She works with community and advocacy groups to educate, engage and motivate people to help build safe streets, complete communities and create a better quality of life.
* She is founder of [the No More Noise Toronto Campaign](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/ec5c54eea28e41569539e8e4247a8a86), creating innovative ways for people to report on noise in their communities. With the Not 311 Noise Report people can log their noise complaints and see them on a map. Additionally, she has collected 1,000s of hours of data from "the bedroom window" from over 40 locations to understand what sound levels people live with.
* Follow Ingrid on Twitter at [@sippindata](https://twitter.com/sippindata), or by using the #nomorenoiseTO hashtag.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the office of the Ontario Digital Service at **595 Bay St. Suite 1002**. Take the elevator to the 10th floor.
* **Enter using the doors on Bay St.**, just north of Dundas. A volunteer from Civic Tech Toronto will be waiting near the elevators on your right!
