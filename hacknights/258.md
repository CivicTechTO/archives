Topic:

Are you curious to learn more established Civic Tech projects? Or interested in leading a project with Civic Tech Toronto, but don't know where to start? Join us to hear more about the highs and lows—what worked and what didn't—from Civic Tech project leaders, including:

Toronto Tech Mentoring, formerly known as the Accelerator Project (Dilini Kurukula)
https://acceleratorproject.xyz. We help individuals who are facing homelessness escape the cycle of poverty by helping them to use tech skills to advance their employment, entrepreneurship, and personal goals.

Law and Design CoLab (Avery Au)
https://lawdesigncolab.ca/
We use design and digital media to make public legal education and advocacy more impactful.

Our Data Futures (David Cox)
http://ourdatafutures.ca/
We want to move the conversation from “what governments and corporations want for data” to “what people want” and to move the decision-making influence into the hands of the people — people whose data is being collected, used, stored, handled for privacy, combined, shared, and kept accurate.
