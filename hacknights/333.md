Topic:
From Welcoming to Inviting – How might we create a tech and innovation ecosystem that is naturally conducive for newcomers to thrive?

A lot of energy is being poured into diversity and inclusion efforts across the Canadian tech ecosystem. While this is commendable, newcomers generally still encounter barriers preventing them from integrating seamlessly into tech careers, startups and funding opportunities. What would it look like if we could build communities that not only welcome people from diverse backgrounds but also intentionally invite them?
