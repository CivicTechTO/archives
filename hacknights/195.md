  Amazing things can happen when civic technologists try to use and improve city data - come hear the story of how an imperfect dataset led to the largest participatory urban forest mapping project in the United States. TreesCount! 2015 scaled a mapping tool developed by civic technologists TreeKIT (http://treekit.org/) into a platform that enabled more than 2,200 volunteers to accurately map New York City's more than 660,000 street trees, and culminated in the development the NYC Street Tree Map - a digital platform for collaborative management of NYC's urban forest.

The building is unfortunately NOT fully accessible. The front entrance has many steps. The back entrance is barrier free with a ramp, but then has 3 interior steps. This back entrance can be reached from either Adelaide (a few doors east of main entrance), or from George St on north side.

+ About us:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you donâ€™t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

+ Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
