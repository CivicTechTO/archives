For our first hacknight of 2017, join us for a big-picture view of Civic Tech Toronto's highlights of 2016, and what's on the horizon for the year ahead. We'll also have an overview of how Civic Tech is organized and how you can contribute!

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you donâ€™t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
