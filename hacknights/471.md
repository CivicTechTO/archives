topic: "Crowdsourcing care: Solving healthcare service gaps with open data"
description: Join us for a talk about open data and civic tech as we look at Fern, a crowdsourced web app designed to help residents of Toronto find family doctors who are currently accepting new patients. With over 2 million Ontarians without a family doctor and no provincial open data system providing real-time information, accessing primary care has become increasingly difficult. Sidra will demonstrate how Fern addresses this issue through community-driven solutions, and highlight the importance of government-released open data in improving healthcare access. The talk will explore how open data empowers civic tech communities to create tools that meet public needs and improve lives. Learn how Fern was developed (in a day!), rapid prototyping, and the pivotal role open data plays in solving real-world challenges.
