description: This week Natalia Dmuchowska, Teresa Liu and Corinna Prior will represent a team of Ryerson grad students working on the [PokePlan](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokeplan) project. The team has been looking at augmented reality and its applications in municipal government and planning. They've scraped Pokemon GO data and applied a geospatial analysis to understand patterns of use in the City of Toronto. The results are interesting and they're looking forward to sharing them with the civictech community!
