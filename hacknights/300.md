topic: Tracking Toronto's supply of affordable rental
description: Anecdotal evidence suggests that deeply affordable rental is disappearing faster than it is being created, but no one has quantified the magnitude of this issue. As part of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s Housing Supply Challenge – Data Driven Round, Purpose Analytics is developing the Low-End of Market Rental Housing Monitor, a tool that will estimate the supply of deeply affordable housing units, where they are located, and track changes over time. Currently in a proof-of-concept stage for Toronto, the project will be competing for the next round of funding to scale to other urban centres in Canada.  www.lemr.ca  www.purposeanalytics.ca
