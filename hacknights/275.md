Speakers:

Sandi MacKinnon, Executive Director of Greater Fredericton Social Innovation and Co-founder/Organizer of Civic Tech Fredericton. Sandi brings to life that spirit of cooperation. This involves a keen eye for potential partnerships on shared problems or challenges, the ability to build a team where there was no team before, and then to promote this new direction to the community. The result is a new creative energy emerges in the community, and the positive feeling of making a difference.
