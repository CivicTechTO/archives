This week Jane Hilderman (@jhilderman (http://twitter.com/jhilderman)) and Christina Vietinghoff from Samara Canada (http://samaracanada.com) (@SamaraCDA (http://twitter.com/SamaraCDA)) will be joining us. Samara aims to reconnect citizens to our democracy, through research and education. Jane and Christina will be speaking about Samara's upcoming MP Exit Interviews—a series of 80 interviews with former Members of the 41st Parliament, about their experiences and recommendations for improving Canadian politics.

Jane Hilderman is an Albertan, a policy wonk and Samara's Executive Director. Her recent accomplishments include testifying before the Parliamentary Electoral Reform Committee and traversing the Rockies by horse.

Christina Vietinghoff grew up in the village that hosted New Brunswick's last fatal duel, and is now passionate about transforming the verbal sparring of partisan parliamentarians into collegial debate. At Samara she manages the MP Exit Interviews project.
