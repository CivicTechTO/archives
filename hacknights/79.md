Presenter: David Janes (@dpjanes (http://twitter.com/dpjanes)). David will be presenting an Open Source Amazon Echo project he wrote to display City of Toronto Open Data, e.g. parks, schools, well-known locations. Results for the queries made to the Amazon Echo are displayed on a kiosk-like web page. He'll also talk about the data normalization process he used (built on Schema.org), to make all the various data sets have a common data format.
