**Topic:** Exploring TTC Delays using Reproducible Data Science.

As most of us know, the TTC has tons of problems– but unless you're an engineer, urban planner or politician, is there even a way for regular citizens to make a difference in solving its issues? It turns out that data science is an incredible tool for non-transit-experts to tell stories that invite thinking about our transit system in a whole new way.

**Speakers:** Luca Carnegie is a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto, studying Digital Design and Data Science in the Bachelor of Information program, with a minor in Economics. In his spare time, he loves listening, singing and playing jazz music, going to concerts, and reading about/testing the latest AI models.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at UofT's Myhal Centre, at 55 St George Street. We'll be in room 380. There will be signs!
