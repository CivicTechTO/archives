Presenter: Jill Crumb and Sylvie Spraakman from Cyanosleuth

“Blue Drinks Toronto and Civic Tech Toronto (http://civictech.ca/) are teaming up to share ideas as part of Ontario Water Innovation Week (https://www.waterinnovationweek.com/).”

Jill Crumb is an ecologist and cyanobacteria consultant. She is currently providing consulting services to the water industry as owner of TreeFrog Environmental.

Sylvie Spraakman is an engineer, community activist, and water lover. She is currently working on her PhD at the University of Toronto.

Lake Erie currently experiences regular cyanobacteria blooms, and citizens don't know whether or not these blooms are toxic. Jill Crumb and Sylvie Spraakman will be discussing Cyanosleuth, a mobile device app with a hardware component that will provide swimmers, fisherman and scientists with rapid, site-specific information on nutrients, algae and cyanobacteria, and cyanotoxins all in the palm of their hand. They have developed this app as part of the AqauHacking 2017 Challenge. This year’s AquaHacking Challenge brought together experts, hackers, and other creative minds to form a team and work for 10 weeks to develop functional, marketable innovations to help solve Lake Erie’s water issues.

“Blue Drinks Toronto is an ongoing water sector event that features dynamic speakers, great people, and an opportunity to meet other water professionals.”
