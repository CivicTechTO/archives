Topic: **How good is Toronto's open data?**

Toronto Open Data will present improvements to its Data Quality Scoring algorithm and interface. The city of Toronto's [Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/) stores lots of data - but whether or not this data is any good is a separate topic! The team behind the portal will share more about what 'good' looks like when it comes to data and how to assess it.

Speaker: **Mackenzie Nichols**

Mackenzie is a software developer on the City of Toronto Open Data Team. He's been involved in Civic Tech Toronto since 2016.

**Join us in person**:

We're meeting at the Centre for Urban Innovation at Toronto Metropolitan University (44 Gerard St. East). There will be a greeter at the front door and the venue is on the third floor. The venue is fully accessible.
