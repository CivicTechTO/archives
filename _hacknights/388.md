Topic: **100% Hacknight**

* There will be no speaker this week. Sometimes, we like to dedicate the whole evening to working on in-flight civic tech projects. So if you're working on a project, would like to get involved in one, or want to pitch a project idea, come join us!

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at Toronto City Hall (100 Queen St. West)
* Entrance is from the south side of the building, from Nathan Philips Square.
* NOTE: Visitors to City Hall must pass through a metal detector. Sharp objects are not allowed, and bags will be searched.
