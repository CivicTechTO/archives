topic: People-Driven Smart Policy
description: |-
  With the tremendous push to become data and technology driven in government policy making and service delivery, have we become too dependent on these tools to the detriment of society? Researchers from Harvard Kennedy School and IBM explore this question in the context of the pandemic. They lay the foundations for People-Driven Smart Policy (PDSP), a new framework to help put public sector leaders back in the driver's seat by maximizing the utility of data, technology and critical thinking.

  Also, Matt & Rashi love cats and wicked problems.
