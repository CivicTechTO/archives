Tonight, we'll be jumping right into breakout groups for projects, discussion, and learning! On top of the breakout groups that community members might pitch, we'll be running the regular Civic Tech 101 orientation session, and a "Dolphin Tank" workshop for new project ideas. (There will be no speaker this week.)

Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to work on, and pizza (or other food) to snack on!
