  Chalmers Cards is a guerilla project fighting homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Right now, they have two products: Chalmers Cards and Chalmers Signal. You might remember the Chalmers Signal live map from breakout group work over the last few months!
  Chalmers Cards are wooden information booklets that are designed to be given out at Toronto's emergency shelters and to folks sleeping on the streets of Toronto. They explain how to access social services.
  The Chalmers Signal hopes to make shelter occupancy data more accessible and faster to communicate among shelters in Toronto. It is an internet connected device that publishes real-time occupancy data amongst shelters around Toronto.
