Cyd Harrell

Cyd Harrell is a UX researcher and product manager who got hooked on civic tech at early 2010s hackathons. When Facebook bought her employer in 2012, she chose to invest her career in public service technology work. Cyd has helped US city, county, federal, and state agencies unlock the power of technology to serve constituents. She has worked independently, with the Center for Civic Design, Code for America, and 18F. Over the years, Cyd has been a mentor and leader to many people in the field, and she is proud to have served as the first chief of staff of 18F. She is dedicated to a more inclusive, more capable, and better coordinated civic tech movement. Cyd lives in San Francisco with her husband and daughter.
