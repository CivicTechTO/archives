Topic: How North America is turning away from cars (and how Toronto is leading this trend)

For the month of November 2022, Civic Tech Toronto is focusing on the theme of transportation. We've invited technologists, advocates, journalists and public servants to share their perspectives on what it's like to move through Canada's largest city.

On Nov. 8, we are joined by **Reece Martin** (the RM in [RMTransit](https://www.youtube.com/c/rmtransit)), an urbanist and public transport critic from Toronto. He'll be discussing how North American cities, and the world more broadly, are moving away from cars, and how upcoming transit projects in Toronto will impact the city.

Join us in person:
We're in the Civic Innovation Office at City Hall (100 Queen St W). Enter through the main doors and turn right at the rotunda. Our in-person venue is limited to 25 people and we encourage all attendees to wear masks.

Speakers:
Reece Martin is an urbanist and public transport critic residing in Toronto, Canada, with the goal of helping the world become more connected through metros, trams, buses, high-speed trains, and all other transport modes. He is the creator and host of RMTransit, a YouTube channel focused on transit, infrastructure, and development around the world.
