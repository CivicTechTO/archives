  The City of Toronto is creating a Digital Infrastructure Plan (DIP) to guide decisions about how digital technologies are designed, developed, and/or put in place by the City of Toronto. Digital infrastructure includes many things that you come into contact with in your day-to-day life—like public WIFI, smart-building sensors in City buildings, or the Green P parking app.
  The City is hosting a consultation on the draft DIP from 6–8pm, and Civic Tech Toronto co-organizers are hosting a community debrief conversation afterwards.
