Presenter: John Richardson from Ethelo (http://twitter.com/ethelo)

John Richardson is the founder and CEO of Ethelo, an online platform for group decision-making. Ethelo is powered by a powerful algorithm that has been described by the Canadian federal government as "a new benchmark of state of art that is clearly ahead of competitors." Ethelo is also a social enterprise, with a mandate to advance new forms of digital democracy and public engagement. John will do a demo of Ethelo and speak about opportunities to use the platform for free to engage citizens in creating mandates for public policy change.

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you donâ€™t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
