The weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policymakers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through tech and design. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!)

Come and be part of it!

Agenda:
6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion with Jennifer Hollett (@jenniferhollett (http://twitter.com/jenniferhollett))

Jennifer recently co-founded a startup and developed “Super PAC App,” which debuted #1 in its category in the App Store, helping make political TV ads more transparent. She is an associate with the Atkinson Foundation, where she authored the report 'Civic Tech for Civic Voice.'
