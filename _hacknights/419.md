Topic: BikeSpace - Mapping Toronto’s bicycle parking needs
BikeSpace is a crowdsourced web app where cyclists can anonymously report bicycle parking issues across Toronto. The application allows users to pinpoint where new and better bike parking could be added – in both private and public locations.

We will be presenting over the latest version of the application and brief history of it at Civic Tech Toronto.

**Speaker:**
Sonal Ranjit has been a part of various projects at Civic Tech Toronto since he first joined the community about 7 years ago. He is a Software Developer by day and avid biker on nights and weekends. He's also obsessed with brewing the perfect cup of coffee, which he attempts every morning.

**Join us in person**:

We're meeting in Room 380 of the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto (55 St. George Street, north of College St., 3rd floor). There will be signs!
