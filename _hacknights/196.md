description: The Civic Tech Field Guide (http://civictech.guide) is an open collection of over 2,000 civic tech entities, from apps to data standards to funders, built and maintained by Civic Hall. We've leveraged the Field Guide to produce a timeline of civic tech projects, spanning from 1994 through 2018. The timeline traces the evolution of our growing field, including the civic hacking meetup boom, and an apparent slowdown in new project launch rate in recent years. Come explore the civic tech timeline, and add your projects to it if they're not already represented.

The Civic Tech Field Guide (http://civictech.guide) is an open collection of over 2,000 civic tech entities, from apps to data standards to funders, built and maintained by Civic Hall. We've leveraged the Field Guide to produce a timeline of civic tech projects, spanning from 1994 through 2018. The timeline traces the evolution of our growing field, including the civic hacking meetup boom, and an apparent slowdown in new project launch rate in recent years. Come explore the civic tech timeline, and add your projects to it if they're not already represented.

Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to work on, and pizza (or other food) to snack on!

+ Biographies:

Matt Stempeck has been researching and building civic technology since 2005. He worked on, with, and in electoral and advocacy campaigns, governments, big tech companies, academia, and journalism.

+ Venue sponsor:

The venue sponsor for this week is Myplanet!

https://www.myplanet.com/

+ Check-in details:

If you run into any issues, then please send a message to our "doorbell" at 647-812-2649 (647-8122-6IX), and the organizers will get a notification.

+ Accessibility:

The building is unfortunately NOT fully accessible. The front entrance has many steps. The back entrance is barrier free with a ramp, but then has 3 interior steps. This back entrance can be reached from either Adelaide (a few doors east of main entrance), or from George St on north side.

We can offer 2 transit tokens per participant per week to those in need of transportation support to get to hacknights. Please ask an organizer to take advantage of this. (We have a set budget for tokens, and if we’re running low, we will make every attempt to update the event description to say so.)

+ About us:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

+ Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
