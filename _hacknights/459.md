topic: Modelling Toronto's Paths to Net Zero
description: As Toronto takes steps toward a sustainable future, the city has introduced the Local Emissions for Net Zero (LENZ) modelling suite. Developed to help Toronto reach its net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target by 2040, LENZ enables the city to test and refine actions and policies by simulating net-zero scenarios. It provides detailed estimates of GHG emissions from everyday activities like heating and lighting homes, driving cars, and riding public buses.

Topic: The City of Toronto's Local Emissions for Net Zero (LENZ) modelling suite

As Toronto takes steps toward a sustainable future, the city has introduced the Local Emissions for Net Zero (LENZ) modelling suite. Developed to help Toronto reach its net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target by 2040, LENZ enables the city to test and refine actions and policies by simulating net-zero scenarios. It provides detailed estimates of GHG emissions from everyday activities like heating and lighting homes, driving cars, and riding public buses.

Speakers:
Da Huo is a researcher at the City of Toronto who works on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. He is the lead developer of the Carbon Monitor Cities dataset, which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 1500+ cities.

Sourabh Jain is a Greenhouse Gas Systems Modeller for the City of Toronto. His work uses a suite of optimization and simulation tools to assess different GHG emission trajectories and inform policy decisions to support Torontoâ€™s transition to net-zero by 2040.
