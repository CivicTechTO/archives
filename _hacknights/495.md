number: 495
date: 2025-05-27
topic: Changes in immigrant voting patterns in the Greater Toronto Area
description: |-
  Immigrants are a key part, and key political constituency, of the Greater Toronto Area. Like all groups, they've had political shifts - most recently, a decisive shift toward the Conservatives.
  Using data visualization and mapping, Aniket Kali reveals how immigrant voting patterns in the GTA have shifted toward the Conservatives. His analysis combines electoral results with census data to create visual stories that challenge assumptions about immigrant voting blocs in Canadian politics.
