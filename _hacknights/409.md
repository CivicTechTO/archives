The developer of a new [TTC Arrivals](https://ttc-bus-eta.pages.dev/) app will share how and why they built the tool, and what they've learned working with transit data.

In their own words: "I wrote a thing to help myself catch the bus."

**Speaker:**

[Thomas Kam](https://github.com/thomassth/ttc-bus-eta) barged their way into a career in programming, and is still kind of amazed that they did so.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the office of the Ontario Digital Service at **595 Bay St. Suite 1002**. Take the elevator to the 10th floor.
* **Enter using the doors on Bay St.**, just north of Dundas. A volunteer from Civic Tech Toronto will be waiting near the elevators on your right!
