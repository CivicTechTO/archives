Post Presentation Notes:
> - I mentioned open code to calculate Level of Traffic Stress yesterday - Madeleine's python code that calculates LTS using Open Street Map data [https://github.com/mbonsma/LTS-OSM/](https://github.com/mbonsma/LTS-OSM/). 
> - My code is modified from Bike Ottawa's great LTS map, and they also have a route planner based on LTS: [https://maps.bikeottawa.ca/planner/web/](https://maps.bikeottawa.ca/planner/web/)
> - People For Bikes in the US uses a version of Level of Traffic Stress to do their city rankings: [https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/about/methodology](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/about/methodology)
