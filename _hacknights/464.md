topic: "The Uncounted and the Unseen: Learning to Work with Dark Data"
description: Good policy starts with good data, and although we live in an increasingly data-rich era, the world of dark data is also growing. We know too little about global mortality, which inhibits healthcare interventions; similarly, we struggle to estimate the number of unhoused in our communities, making it difficult to petition for more affordable housing. Solving problems which involve data that is uncollected, unstructured or otherwise obfuscated requires a new toolkit of best practices based on familiar principles of secure data governance. We'll talk about a few of these challenges as a way of illuminating a path through the problem of dark data. https://darkdataproject.org
