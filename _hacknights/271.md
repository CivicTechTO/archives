description: MediaSmarts, Canada's centre for digital and media literacy, has been surveying and interviewing young Canadians about their online lives since 2000. This talk will look at what they've learned about how youth imagine and negotiate digital privacy, with a spotlight on recent 'paper prototyping' research which asked young people to re-design how platforms get consent to collect and use their personal information.
