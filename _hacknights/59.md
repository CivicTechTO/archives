Pamela Clark from the Office of Community Engagement at the City of Brampton is joining us for this hacknight!

This week Civic Tech Toronto is also celebrating Toronto Democracy Week! As part of the festivities this Tuesday, we’re holding a special workshop with Mark Richardson (https://twitter.com/mjrichardson_to), CTO of Rose-Richardson Enterprise, who will give us the 101 of presenting deputations at City Hall. Learn the ins and outs of the art. What to expect. What you can bring. And how to best deliver your message.

About the Hacknight

The weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policymakers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through tech, data, and design. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!)

Come and be part of it!
