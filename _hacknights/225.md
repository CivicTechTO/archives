+ Venue Sponsor:

University of Toronto Faculty of Information

+ Check-in details:

This month we're at University of Toronto's St. George Campus in the Bissell Building.

It's located on 140 St. George Street (at Sussex Avenue), adjacent to Robarts Library. We're meeting on the 7th Floor (Room 728).

If you run into any issues, send a message to our "doorbell" at 647-812-2649, and the organizers will get a notification.

+ Accessibility:

The main entrance on St. George Street has many steps. A wheelchair-accessible entrance is located around the corner from it on Sussex Avenue, on the northwest side of the building. Once you're in the building, take the elevator up to the 7th floor.

Washrooms are located on every floor and include a universal washroom on the 4th floor and a gender-neutral washroom on the 6th floor.

We can offer 2 transit tokens per participant per week to those in need of transportation support to get to hacknights. Please ask an organizer to take advantage of this. (We have a set budget for tokens, and if we‚Äôre running low, we will make every attempt to update the event description to say so.)

+ About Us:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don‚Äôt have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

+ Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (go make something!)
