Topic: **100% Hacknight**

* There will be no speaker this week. Sometimes, we like to dedicate the whole evening to working on in-flight civic tech projects. So if you're working on a project, would like to get involved in one, or want to pitch a project idea, come join us!

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto (55 St. George Street). There will be signs!
