Topic:
CivApp is a cooperative non-partisan, non-profit public participation platform - believing that an appealing and productive tech solution to public-engagement will improve democracy. CivApp aims to simplify the connection between values and responsible government bodies, how change happens, and be a transparent record that encourages representative accountability.

Speakers:
Hriday's background meets at the intersection of community engagement, government, and tech. Beginning with outreach at an environmental non-profit, then Compliance Promotion at Environment Canada, and transitioning to tech these last few years- Hriday brings an empathy for the diverse values that make up our communities and further, an understanding of how governance is losing to online misinformation and the revenue models of our favorite tech platforms.
