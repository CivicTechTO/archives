The designer/developer duo plan to touch on the following topics:

- how diverse backgrounds and meandering career paths can bring human and social perspectives to their approaches to tech
- why we should all bring a bit of our personal lives into our work and vice versa
- insights on designing for the web while keeping our intentions in line with positive and sustained social impact

Luisa and Sharon would also like to chit chat away with everyone joining the virtual meetup on ways design and technology are empowering communities, initiatives, and organizations at various scales and enabling them to support each other's work under the effects of the pandemic lockdown. How do we ensure that this work and all the good intentions going into it are not lost in the "new normal"?

Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from and some projects to work on.
