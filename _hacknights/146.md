  The Toronto dollar was a paper local currency from 1998-2013. It had fixed exchange rates with the Canadian dollar. A lower exchange rate was used when trading Toronto dollars for Canadian dollars than vice versa, and the income from this disparity was used to fund social benefit programs.

  Through sheer determination and will, Joy developed and sustained the program while inspiring numerous volunteers to help.

  'Society needs glue, the wherewithal to connect with each other. I feel that's what the Toronto Dollar is – it's a form of glue, it's a means of connecting community organizations, local businesses and citizens. It's also a form of making visible people who care, making the heart more visible,' she says.
