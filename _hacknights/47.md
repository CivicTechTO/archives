The weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policymakers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through tech and design. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!)

This week's hacknight features Jay Wall (http://twitter.com/Jay_Wall) / Studio Jaywall (http://jaywall.com/). Jay will speak about the role of communications design in public engagement, telling the story of designing the campaign for the TOcore city planning study.

For the whole month of June, hacknights are co-presented by the Emerging Leaders Network (ELN) (http://www.elnonline.ca/).

Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion with Jay Wall (http://twitter.com/Jay_Wall) / Studio Jaywall (http://jaywall.com)
