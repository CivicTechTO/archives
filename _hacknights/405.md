Join Ingrid Buday, founder of No More Noise Toronto to see how you can help create a more healthy, inclusive and social city by reducing noise.

Speaker: **Ingrid Buday**

* Ingrid started gathering sound level data two years ago, and since then has been collaborating with people who care about their soundscapes. She has been in the media, deputed on noise and is working with local groups to gather data to create an evidence based argument to reduce the noise in our cities in advance of the Noise Bylaw Review in Q4 of 2023.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the Centre for Urban Innovation at Toronto Metropolitan University (44 Gerard St. East). There will be a greeter at the front door and the venue is on the third floor. The venue is fully accessible.
