  Prior to the pandemic, the average wait times in Canada to see a specialist was over 20 weeks - and we were willing to live with those wait times. However, COVID-19 has really changed the healthcare landscape across the country.

  Wait times are now drastically longer. Elective surgeries have been cancelled. We now need to triage whether a patient can be taken care of by our healthcare system and people are literally dying while they wait. This has all but forced healthcare to go digital - even when we were not prepared.

  In this talk, we will discuss some of the challenges, trends, and the good news on where we are going with digital health.
