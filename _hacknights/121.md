A civic tech community brainstorm

We've seen a lot of excitement -- and some concern -- about the Waterfront Toronto + Sidewalk Labs project (http://sidewalktoronto.ca) at Quayside. At this stage, there are more questions than answers. So on Dec 5th, we're running a community brainstorming session, to answer the question: What would the civic tech community like to see at Quayside?

In addition to the regular hacknight project breakouts, this one-night-only facilitated session will get participants thinking big about how digital technology could be used to help make the Eastern Waterfront a thriving, inclusive, sustainable community.

***

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)

This venue is fully accessible.
