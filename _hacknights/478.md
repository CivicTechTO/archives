topic: The Civics Project - Indexing all of Canadian politics
description: |-
  While the government has grown increasingly complex, the bias in news coverage has emboldened.

  The Civics Project’s mission is to index and summarize all of Canadian politics.
  Having summarized the current House of Commons bills and votes, along with $751 billion of federal spending, Mikaal Naik from the Civics Project will discuss the project’s current progress.

  We’ll also talk about future features to bring accountability and engagement to public policy.
