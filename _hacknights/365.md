Topic:
**Torontoverse: Local media built from open data**

Introducing Torontoverse ([https://tovrs.ca](https://tovrs.ca)), a local media site that imagines the city as an interactive video game. It's stitching open data, innovative reporting, and the "local web" together into a new kind of thing.

Speakers:
Chris Dinn is a software engineer with passion for media innovation. He's worked on video streaming, ad serving and even (briefly) file systems for an experimental new OS. Now, he's the publisher of Torontoverse.
