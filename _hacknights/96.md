  The City of Toronto has created the Civic Innovation Office, which will help solve municipal service delivery challenges by creating a bridge between City divisions and Toronto’s growing innovation and technology communities.
  The Civic Innovation Office will be housed within the City Manager’s Office and apply technology, data analysis and design thinking to develop and test solutions to challenges faced by Toronto residents. The office is fully funded through Bloomberg Philanthropies, a collective that works to address pressing urban challenges to improve the quality of life for local residents. Recently, Bloomberg selected Toronto as the first Canadian city to join its global network of Innovation Teams.
