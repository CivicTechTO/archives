Topic: Innovative technologies and processes in the Ontario Public Service

Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to work on, and pizza (or other food) to snack on!

+ Presenter:

Christopher Humphries, former Senior Policy Advisor to the President of the Ontario Treasury Board

+ Biography:

Prior to the June 2018 provincial election Christopher advised the President of the Ontario Treasury Board Secretariat on all IT related matters, including IT strategy, procurement, implementation, governance, and the Ontario Digital Service. Christopher has also held private sector project and project management roles and worked closely with senior executives at CGI - Canada to develop and implement corporate strategy.

+ Venue Sponsor:

Our January hacknights are being sponsored by two groups from the University of Toronto!
The Urban Policy Lab and Policy Innovation Initiative are collaborating to host us at the Canadiana Gallery.

+ Check-in details:

To be announced. If you run into any issues, then please send a message to our "doorbell" at 780-652-2649 (780-6LAB-6IX), and the organizers will get a notification.

+ Accessibility:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you donâ€™t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!
