topic: Behind The Yellowhead Treaty Map - Reclaiming Indigenous Perspectives on Treaties in Canada
description: |-
  Treaties are the highest law of the land but in Canada, their histories are often erased or mal-interpreted in order to facilitate the ongoing material dispossession of Indigenous peoples.
  The Yellowhead Treaty Map is an intervention, an accessible introduction to Indigenous perspectives on treaties, illuminating real and often obscured obligations and relationalities in Canada.
  Join two Treaty Map producers for a short presentation on how and why the map was conceptualized and developed.
