  Texture is an interactive fiction creation tool created by Jim Munroe and Juhana Leinonen to explore the possibility space between Inform and Twine.

  Recently added features like google auth and private libraries facilitate use in the elementary and highschool classrooms. A professional narrative designer, Jim Munroe has done a dozen Texture workshops in three countries as a way to teach adults how to write for interactive. The Texture team is interested in hearing about the opportunities that open sourcing the project may present.
