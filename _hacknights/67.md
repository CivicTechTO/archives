Given the fact that there'll likely be interest, we'll be skipping our usual post-event drinks in favour of joining CivicAction's US Election Night viewing party (https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/us-election-night-with-the-eln-tickets-28534497450) at Firkin on Yonge. We extend the invite to follow us there after our event ends at 9pm. RSVP highly recommended.

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
