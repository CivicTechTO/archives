Presenter: Justin Bull (@f3ndot (http://twitter.com/f3ndot)) on doored.ca (@dooredCA (http://twitter.com/dooredCA))

He will be talking about how his Doored.ca (http://doored.ca/) project came to be. How it resulted in a media buzz, influenced policy, and garnered civic action.

Justin Bull is a security enthusiast, cycling nutbar and software engineer at Wealthsimple. He created Doored.ca and MyBikeLane projects to advocate for Toronto cycling.

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
