topic: Enabling Citizen-Sourced Speeding Data Using Raspberry Pi and Motion Tracking
description: By using open source motion tracking software, regular citizens can now build their very own speed camera at a reasonable price. With vehicle collisions at an all-time high in Toronto and little enforcement (or innovation) to address the issue, we will review how citizens can share self-generated data to help fill a key data gap on the where, when and who of dangerous vehicle speeds. If you have interest in the road safety in our communities and/or experience with Raspberry Pi, python, sqlite, ML (opencv), project management or road design policy, we'd love to get your feedback and involvement in this project!
