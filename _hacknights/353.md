Topic:
Campaign Cash: Using Open Data to follow the money at Toronto City Hall

After he published an analysis of more than a decade of municipal campaign donations collected from Toronto’s Open Data portal in his City Hall Watcher newsletter, Matt Elliott asked readers asking if anyone could build an interactive, searchable database. Developer Jeff McCartney answered the call, building a tool they called [Campaign Cash](https://cityhallwatcher.com/campaigncash/). Matt and Jeff will explain how it all came together.

Matt Elliott & Jeff McCartney

Until March of this year **Jeff McCartney** was a Data & Geoinformatics specialist for the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure, where he got to turn huge data sets into really cool maps. Prior to that he was a developer and project manager for several other ministries within the Ontario government. In 2013 he founded [WAVEiii](http://www.waveiii.com) (that’s Wave Three), an online sports & activities challenge designed for large organizations with employees in multiple countries. Jeff has several bikes and actually rides them in Toronto.
