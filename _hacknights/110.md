description: "Peer 2 Peer University, or just P2PU, facilitates equitable learning beyond institutional walls. It is developing a new model for online and offline learning called learning circles: lightly-facilitated study groups for people who want to take online courses, together, in-person. The presentation will highlight how the Toronto Public Library, along with libraries across the world, are using learning circles to achieve accessible education, support digital inclusion and take advantage of open education resources."
