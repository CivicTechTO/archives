Hey civic tech enthusiasts, it’s summertime!

For July and August, we’re simplifying hacknights, to give our volunteer organizers a little more downtime. If you've been to a civic tech Toronto hacknight before, you may notice some changes for our summer version:

- No presentations in August
- No announcement segment: share in chat or on Slack
- Civic Tech 101 will be back in September
- Likely fewer breakout groups

Have a project idea you want to get off the ground? Or a topic you want to discuss with others? Or do you want to contribute your skills & knowledge to a project or discussion that addresses a civic issue in Toronto?

Bring your thoughts, energy, and experiences to this full session hacknight! Everyone is welcome.
