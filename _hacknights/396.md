  Pornhub Insights routinely circulates fun, colourful infographics detailing the porn viewing habits of millions of global users. Porn watching is often conceived of as a fundamentally private activity, but Insights' cheeky posts boast of a media model premised on user surveillance. This talk will review some underlying implications around algorithmically curated media's role in shaping categories of sexual preference on platforms.
  Please note: while this talk will not include any explicit sexual imagery, it does engage with sexual themes, language and porn content.
