Topic: From Science to Society - How the U of T Impact Centre helps scientists & technologists use their expertise to benefit the world through entrepreneurship.

Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to work on, and pizza (or other food) to snack on!

+ Presenter:

Leo Mui, Manager, Entrepreneurship Initiatives, University of Toronto Impact Centre

+ Venue Sponsor:

Connected is our venue and food sponsor for November 2018!
They are a development firm that works with different companies to "build products that drive user and business impact."

A big thank-you to Connected for providing us with an awesome venue (their Toronto office) and for all the delicious food.
This week we'll be chowing down on pasta from Pizza Rustica!
