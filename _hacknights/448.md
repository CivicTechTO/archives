For this session, it will be **pitches and breakouts only**. Join us next week for our regular scheduled programming.

Join us for a full two hours of breakout groups for project work, discussion, and learning! In addition to the breakout groups, which community members might pitch, we'll run the regular Civic Tech 101 orientation.

Come join an existing project or pitch a new one. Help chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at UofT's Myhal Centre, at 55 St George Street. We'll be in room 380. There will be signs!
