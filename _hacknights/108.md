description: The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development is investigating innovative ways to build data literacy and data confidence within our organization. We imagine (and have experienced!) that people in analytic roles spend a lot of time helping out non-data-minded colleagues to navigate problems that take time away from analytic work. We are interested in your thoughts on how we can build a program and what tools we would need to increase data literacy and confidence for policy analysts, program analysts and administrative staff.
