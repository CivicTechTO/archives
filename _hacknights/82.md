topic: UofT Innovation Hub
description: The Innovation Hub is a project at the University of Toronto that uses design-thinking methodology as a student-centered approach to improving the student experience. Our work is anchored by innovative and collaborative work teams made up of students, faculty and staff from a variety of disciplines. Through interviews, conversations and observations, we gathered insights from students in order to understand student-life from their perspectives. These insights inspired the development of twenty-five project ideas designed to meet student needs. In this presentation we will describe what our work looked like, discuss challenges that arose, and share our insights about using a design-thinking approach to creating solutions for unmet needs.
