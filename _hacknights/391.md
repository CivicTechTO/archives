Topic: **Engaging with City Council 101**

Engaging with your Councillor’s office and City Council is an important avenue for your advocacy on issues that impact you and your communities (including Civic Tech issues!). It can be intimidating to take the first step – what are your options? How do you know when it’s the right time to reach out? How can you be sure you'll have an impact? *Learn about the many ways you can get engaged with City Council (from someone who works in a Councillor’s office!)*

Speaker: **Sam McGarva**

* Sam McGarva is a long-time Civic Tech Toronto co-organizer and a short-time City Councillor staff who believes in the value of civic engagement.
* Sam will be presenting in-person.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the office of the Ontario Digital Service at **595 Bay St. Suite 1002**. Take the elevator to the 10th floor.
* **Enter using the doors on Bay St.**, just north of Dundas. A volunteer from Civic Tech Toronto will be waiting near the elevators on your right!
