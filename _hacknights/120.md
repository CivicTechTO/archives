title: "Hacknight #120 â€“ Driftscape"
description: Driftscape is an app that transforms your city into a living museum. You can learn about where you are, on your own schedule, from diverse local experts. Our presentation will discuss the Driftscape platform which enables local organizations to share site-specific arts, culture and history content. We believe that creating a platform where diverse stories can be shared will inspire a greater understanding of the spaces we inhabit and the people we share them with.
