  OldTO is an open source project that showcases Toronto's history through photographs and aerial imagery from the Toronto Archives. I'll walk through the Archives collection, how we located the photos on the map and what the future holds for the project. We strongly believe that technology can help us connect with the past, and we're excited to collaborate with the Civic Tech community on the project.

*** THIS MONTH'S VENUE SPONSOR:

Mozilla Toronto

Mozilla's mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

Check-in details: Door will be locked after 7, so please arrive prior. RSVP and sign-in required. If you run into any issues, then please send a message to our "doorbell" at 780-652-2649 (780-6LAB-6IX), and the organizers will get a notification.

Accessibility: The venue is accessible, but unfortunately it's not a spectacular experience. Guests who rely on mobility assistance will need to come in through the rear entrance - somebody will need to get the door for them - but can get from there to the front elevator without issue. (Please text the doorbell number above for assistance.)

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you donâ€™t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
