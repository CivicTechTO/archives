description: Throughout my practice as an urban geographer and artist, I have experimented with art as an approach to city-building. After describing my methods, I will share highlights from my projects -- including All the Libraries Toronto, Development Proposal, and the Social Distance Machine -- that have contributed to city-building campaigns with playful visualizations and impactful communications.
