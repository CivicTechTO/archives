The weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policymakers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through tech and design. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!)

Come and be part of it!

More about our presentation this week:

An unlikely partnership uses civic tech to 'hack the system' for low-income housing

Co-presented by Judy Duncan (ACORN Canada), and Kate Collins (lead for this former Toronto Star lab project)

In 2014, the Toronto Star’s digital lab was obsessed with civic data. They had a hypothesis that the right data could act as a hub, drawing community partners, its audience and newsroom to relate differently to each other as they tackled social goals. David Eaves, an open government ‘visionary’, imagined how SeeClickFix’s 311 ticketing service could be pointed at more ambitious problems than Rob Ford’s potholes. ACORN Canada, a membership-led advocacy non for profit, wanted passionately for people to see and hear about the inequity of moldy walls, leaky taps, bug infestations, and other deplorable conditions in Toronto’s low-income housing. And the Atkinson Foundation saw an opportunity to go beyond being a funder. This is the story of what happened. It may not be the classic ‘civic tech’ project but it is the story of an unlikely and informal partnership, its ups, downs and its possibilities.
