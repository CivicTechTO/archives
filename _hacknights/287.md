topic: Helping Newcomers Find Services through Apps
description: "Newcomers to Canada have to navigate a complex system to build a life in Canada. To help them through this process there are a number of organizations but it isn't always for newcomers to find that help. To help bridge this gap a new mobile application has been developed: CanSettle. We will go through the app's development, the future plans, and how you can help!"
