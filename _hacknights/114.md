Presenting the Brookfield + MAESD Design Challenge

MAESD is launched the Student Pathways Challenge! This is a 6-week competition that encourages participants to form teams or work independently to develop digital solutions that answer the question: How might we help high school students gain a better understanding of available employment opportunities and the pathways to get there by means of a digital tool or resource?
The challenge website is provided below *as well as an eventbrite link to the Launch Event happening at HackerYou October 19th*
