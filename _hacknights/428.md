Topic: **Lace up and Go Skate!**

I'm going to speak about how playing hockey myself impacted the way I developed and designed my Go Skate app.

Speaker: **Yitzchok Gray**

* I'm a full time student, and during my free time I like turning ideas into apps. I've been coding for 9 years, since high school, but even longer than that I've been playing ice hockey!

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting in Room 350 of the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto (55 St. George Street, north of College St., 3rd floor). There will be signs!
