+ Biographies:

Cara Chellew is a researcher and public space advocate based
in Toronto, Canada. She received her Masters in Environmental Studies
(Planning) at York University and is the founder of the Defensive
Urban Design Research Network. In November 2018, she gave a TEDx talk
in Tartu, Estonia called "Rethinking defensive urban design" and has
written articles that have been published in the Canadian Journal of
Urban Research, Spacing Magazine, and the Ontario Planning Journal.

+ Venue Sponsor:

Our venue sponsor is Myplanet!

Myplanet is a software studio that makes smarter interfaces. They believe technology should act on your behalf to empower your employees and engage your customers. They're also a B Corporation and were the first tech company in Toronto to achieve the designation.

+ Check-in details:

The entrance is on Adelaide Street East. The door will be unlocked until 7:30 p.m. Just walk in.

If you run into any issues, please notify Kristen Morith via Slack, or send a message to our "doorbell" at 647-812-2649, and the organizers will get a notification.

+ Accessibility:

Myplanet's offices are in one of the oldest buildings in Toronto. As a result, accessibility is unfortunately limited.

The main entrance to the building on Adelaide Street East has many steps. The back entrance (accessed from George Street) has a ramp, but there are still three steps between it and the area that the hacknight will take place in. It also will be locked and requires a key-fob to open. If you need access, please notify Kristen Morith via Slack, or send a message to our "doorbell" at 647-812-2649, and the organizers will get a notification.

We can offer 2 transit tokens per participant per week to those in need of transportation support to get to hacknights. Please ask an organizer to take advantage of this. (We have a set budget for tokens, and if we’re running low, we will make every attempt to update the event description to say so.)

+ About Us:

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

+ Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (go make something!)
