➝ Are you interested in getting more involved with Civic Tech Toronto, but aren't sure where to start?
➝ Are you part of another group that meets online, and interested in hearing about how our group organizes our online hacknights?
➝ Are you just generally interested in how things come together to keep these online events going?

We'll be sharing an overview of the co-organizer roles that keep CTTO running, including:
• Emcee
• Chat Mod
• Civic Tech 101 Host
• Social Host
• Comms
• Speaker Booker

With a Q&A afterwards to answer all the specific questions you have :)
