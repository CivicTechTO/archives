Presenter: Matt Elliott (@GraphicMatt (https://twitter.com/GraphicMatt)) is the city columnist with Metro News Toronto. He’s been writing about budgets, policy and city hall shenanigans since since 2011.

Matt will tell the story of his CITY COUNCIL SCORECARD, a successful data-driven attempt to hold city councillors accountable with a very large, very nerdy spreadsheet during the tumultuous times of Mayor Rob Ford.

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
