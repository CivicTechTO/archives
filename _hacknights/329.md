description: Thomas Linder is joining us to talk about his doctoral research into the rise of digital surveillance technologies in Canadian policing. His work shows that police services are implementing a wide range of digital data collection and analysis tools, yet there is little public discussion of appropriate governance policy from the perspective of the affected communities. In this democratic blackout the police have been implementing technologies and practices modelled after post-9/11 US domestic counter-terrorism units. He argues that civic technology movements have an important role to play in pushing for properly democratic, public oversight and governance of police technology usage.
