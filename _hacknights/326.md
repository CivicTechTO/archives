Speaker
Ingrid Buday

Bio: I have reinvented myself many times, most recently spent a decade in HR and moved into IT configuring software. I took a GIS course last winter which opened my eyes to this new technology and have been running with it ever since!

Topic:
I will present how I have been using the GeoApp technology from ESRI to work with community and advocacy groups to educate, engage and motivate people to make streets safer and improve the quality of their lives. I will demonstrate how I have used the technology and what I have used it for. I would also like to get feedback from participants on their thoughts on how it can be used and shared.
