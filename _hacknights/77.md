  Digital government is about simpler, faster, better public services. Using the power of the internet, modern technology and service design, it’s about improving the online experience for citizens and transforming government services – whether it's ordering a vehicle permit, applying for student aid or finding a health service near home.
  'Cause isn’t that what people deserve? And what public service should be about?

Presenter: Andre Cote (SPPG ’09 grad) and Grahame Rivers will be talking to the group about Ontario's Digital Government agenda – and the role civic tech can play in it.

Digital government is about simpler, faster, better public services. Using the power of the internet, modern technology and service design, it’s about improving the online experience for citizens and transforming government services – whether it's ordering a vehicle permit, applying for student aid or finding a health service near home.

'Cause isn’t that what people deserve? And what public service should be about?

Andre Cote is Senior Advisor to the Honourable Deb Matthews, Ontario's Deputy Premier and Minister Responsible for Digital Government (and the grizzled guy in the old SPPG poster); Grahame Rivers is Digital Director to the Honourable Premier Kathleen Wynne (and the most dapper man at Queen’s Park).
