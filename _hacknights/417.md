For October 2023, Civic Tech Toronto is focusing on housing. We've invited technologists, advocates, journalists and public servants to share their perspectives on one of Toronto's most pressing issues.

On Oct. 31, we'll be joined by May Warren, the Toronto Star's housing reporter. Before taking on the housing beat, she spent two years covering the pandemic, from the first days of the new virus in the city to the vaccine rollout. She's very interested in data journalism and has used data in her reporting on the pandemic, and now as part of the housing team.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the office of the Ontario Digital Service at **595 Bay St. Suite 1002**. Take the elevator to the 10th floor.
* **Enter using the doors on Bay St.**, just north of Dundas. A volunteer from Civic Tech Toronto will be waiting near the elevators on your right!
