**Topic:** Equity in Transportation: Who's Missing from Our Data?
**Speaker:** Léa Ravensbergen, PhD (She/Her), Assistant Professor, School of Earth, Environment & Society, McMaster University

Dr. Léa Ravensbergen will discuss gaps in commonly used transportation data sources. She will draw from her work on transit use among older adults, the cycling gender gap, and highlight how sources like the Census omit important trip purposes beyond commuting. This talk will be relevant to anyone interested in ensuring equitable and inclusive transportation planning.
