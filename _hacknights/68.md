description: This week Natalia Dmuchowska, Teresa Liu and Corinna Prior will represent a team of Ryerson grad students working on the PokePlan project. The team has been looking at augmented reality and its applications in municipal government and planning. They've scraped Pokemon GO data and applied a geospatial analysis to understand patterns of use in the City of Toronto. The results are interesting and they're looking forward to sharing them with the civictech community!
