  Urban noise isn't just an annoyance: research shows that excessive noise has a range of health impacts.
  tRacket is an all-volunteer project to collect and share data about urban noise. Noise level data is valuable for better understanding the patterns of urban noise, and to assist with advocacy and enforcement.
  Over the past few months, we've created low-cost, privacy-aware custom hardware sensors to monitor noise levels, a cloud database and API, and a dashboard to visualize noise levels. We're excited to present our work, as we enter a beta testing phase.
