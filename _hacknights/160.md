topic: "Tech, meet history: About Alternative Toronto"
description: Lilian Radovac will speak about her project Alternative Toronto, a digital community archive that is documenting the city's radical and countercultural histories of the 1980s and 1990s. Using some of the material the project has crowdsourced so far, she'll discuss the importance of thinking about tech both critically and historically, and underscore how the struggles of the past can help us to resist injustice in the city today.
