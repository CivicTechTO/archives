Presenters: Amy Swenson (@indigirl (http://twitter.com/indigirl)) and Ebony Sager (@ebonysager (http://twitter.com/ebonysager))

To inform the 2017/18 Budget, Ontario has recently wrapped up its third annual online consultation, BudgetTalks (http://talks.ontario.ca/). Learn about the evolution of BudgetTalks, what made this year unique, and how we think it went.

Amy Swenson comes from a coding/design/writing/entrepreneur background and is currently the Assistant Director of Ontario.ca. She is passionate about public service, user-focused design, web technologies, and using wOBA as a measure of a hitter’s true ability.

Ebony Sager is the Team Lead of Digital Strategy and Product Development for Ontario.ca and is passionate about improving our experiences with government, in any channel, but especially digital.

Our weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!) Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-7:30: Presentation and Q&A/discussion
7:30-9: Breakout groups (make something!)
