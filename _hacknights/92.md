The [Open Architecture Collaborative](http://openarchcollab.org)'s mission is to look at the long-term (slow) disasters -- such as homelessness, displacement, and gentrification -- which architecture/design created; and how can we address these problems within our communities. Creating sustainable solutions that connect with our stakeholders' identities, desire, and values; meeting their needs in an innovative and socially responsible design.

Sarita Parmar recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelors of Arts in Human Geography and American Studies before joining OACTo as a Project Management Assistant.

Shanna-Kay Smith graduated from The School of Interior Design at Ryerson Univerity; she is the Chapter Director, developing the strategy and objectives for Open Architecture Toronto.
