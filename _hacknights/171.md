topic: How-to create social impact by asking for help
description: |-
  Women and Color is a federally registered non-profit with a mission to advance and promote underrepresented folks in tech. And yet, for all of its growth and success, Women and Color wouldn't be the organization it is today if it wasn't through the ongoing support of like-minded volunteers that came together every week at CivicTechTO.

  Join us to get a behind-the-scene look at Women and Color's year-long journey in building its new website and what they've been up to since 'graduating' from CivicTechTO.
