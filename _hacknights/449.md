Topic: What is Toronto Open Data Even Doing?

Toronto Open Data recently started sharing what they are doing on a day-to-day basis. This new dataset lets the public keep tabs on the city's open data efforts and get insight into what, in some cases, is taking so long.

Speaker: Mackenzie Nichols

Mackenzie is the supervisor of the Toronto Open Data team, who oversee open.toronto.ca. He lives in the Junction with his wife and wishes he could write a better bio for himself than this.
