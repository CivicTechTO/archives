Topic: **Celebrating 8 years of Civic Tech Toronto!**

Join us to celebrate Civic Tech Toronto's 8th birthday and 400th hacknight -- all in one evening! We'll come together, reflect on the past and brainstorm what civic tech and civic engagement might look like in 2031 -- eight years and 400 more hacknights from now.

Speakers: **Toronto's civic tech community, past, present and future**

In place of our regular hacknight, we'll be running a one-night only facilitated workshop -- in-person and online -- to get participants thinking big about the city we'd hope to live in, in 2031. Everyone is welcome!

**Join us in person**:

We're meeting in Room 380 of the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto (55 St. George Street, north of College St.).
