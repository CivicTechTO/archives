Come help us chip away at civic problems by combining technology with the power of our community. We've got everything you need for a perfect Tuesday night: a presentation to learn from, some projects to work on, and pizza (or other food) to snack on!

+ Presenter:

Updates from the PDIS workshop

+ Venue Sponsor:

Connected is our venue and food sponsor for November 2018!
They are a development firm that works with different companies to "build products that drive user and business impact."

A big thank-you to Connected for providing us with an awesome venue (their Toronto office) and for all the delicious food.
This week we'll be enjoying Filipino cuisine from Tita Flips!
