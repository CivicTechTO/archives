For October 2023, Civic Tech Toronto is focusing on housing. We've invited technologists, advocates, journalists and public servants to share their perspectives on one of Toronto's most pressing issues.

On Oct. 24, we'll be joined by Zachary Donsky. Zach has been leading civic tech projects related to homelessness and housing for years, including [Chalmers Cards](https://www.chalmerscards.com/) and [Open Shelter Space](https://openshelter.space/). He'll share his experience, and discuss his latest effort to track and map shelter availability in Toronto using open source tools.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at the office of the Ontario Digital Service at **595 Bay St. Suite 1002**. Take the elevator to the 10th floor.
* **Enter using the doors on Bay St.**, just north of Dundas. A volunteer from Civic Tech Toronto will be waiting near the elevators on your right!
