**Topic:** Building Scattered Unit Co-Ops in Toronto

Jim will be presenting his research on how housing co-ops are the optimal solution for achieving housing equity, security, and sustainability. He believes that we can significantly increase the number of housing co-ops by replacing single-family homes. Currently, he is engaging with developers and conducting market research and geographic analysis to pioneer the next generation of housing co-ops.

**Speaker:** Jim Rootham has been the finance chair at Alexandra Park Co-op for most of the past 30 years, as well as a board member and president on occasion. He has been a member of the More Co-op Housing Collective since 2019.

**Join us in person**:

* We're meeting at UofT's Myhal Centre, at 55 St George Street. We'll be in room 380. There will be signs!
