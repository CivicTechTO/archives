description: Just before the pandemic, the Canadian Digital Service (CDS) was helping Economic and Social Development Canadian (ESDC) put the Canadian Pension Plan Disability (CPP-D) application online. While COVID happened and that body of work was put on hold, the team used a few different approaches to change hearts, minds, and tech about delivering human centred technology. This is a quick talk about how the team used discovery and prototyping approaches to do that.

Topic: Discovery and redesign on disability benefits

Just before the pandemic, the Canadian Digital Service (CDS) was helping Economic and Social Development Canadian (ESDC) put the Canadian Pension Plan Disability (CPP-D) application online. While COVID happened and that body of work was put on hold, the team used a few different approaches to change hearts, minds, and tech about delivering human centred technology. This is a quick talk about how the team used discovery and prototyping approaches to do that.
