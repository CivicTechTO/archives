  Women and Color is a community of talented women and people of colour who are available for speaking opportunities at tech-related events. The goal of the organization is to foster more and better representation of diverse voices in the tech industry. The website started out as a Toronto-specific Wordpress site, and through the help of the Civic Tech community has been redeveloped as a custom web app that’s ready to scale to cities across North America.
  Last week, Women and Color had its soft launch. Today, we’ll talk about some of the challenges we faced (and are still facing) and lessons we learned from the past year of volunteer-driven product development at Civic Tech. https://beta.womenandcolor.com Special shoutout to our contributors: Erin, Mark, Matt, Rose, Sarah, Eric, Maju, and everyone else who has supported us!
