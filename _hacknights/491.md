topic: Civic Dashboard - Turning Passion Into Action By Making Council Accessible To All
description: |-
  It shouldn't take 3 hours and a political science degree to understand City Council and how to meaningfully engage with it.
  Civic Dashboard (civicdashboard.ca) is a 100% volunteer-run effort to make it take a few minutes, make Toronto the most people-powered version of itself, and have fun doing it!
  Understand how Council works, see your councillor's voting record, get alerts whenever an item relevant to you is coming up, and take meaningful action with 1 click - and we're just getting started üòÅ
