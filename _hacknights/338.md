topic: Municipal Critical Infrastructure & Cybersecurity
description: From water, transportation, energy and more, our lives are shaped by the critical infrastructure services provided by our municipal governments. These infrastructure systems have increasingly been connected to information technologies over the past few decades to improve efficiency and service delivery. The reliance on these Internet-connected systems leaves critical municipal infrastructure open to new domestic and foreign exposures and threats that can have devastating consequences. With rising cyber attacks and geopolitical tensions, how can municipalities be better supported in their work to protect their critical infrastructure systems from cyber threats? https://twitter.com/cyberpolicyx
