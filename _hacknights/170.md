+ Accessibility:

The venue is accessible, but entering the building can be tricky. There are two ways to enter 370 King St W:
1) If you are entering from 370 King Street W, there is a lift available with instructions on the lift and a number to call the Security Officer on duty to assist with access.
2) If you do not want to use the lift, you can also enter behind the building through the accessible Widmer St. entrance, then navigate to the elevators.
