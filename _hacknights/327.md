  The Ontario Internship Program(OIP) invests in committed, talented graduates seeking a great opportunity to start and accelerate their careers. It's a paid developmental opportunity to grow top talent while delivering important public services to the people of Ontario.
  The OIP recruits candidates in 7 focus areas. Each focus area represents a line of work that is essential to serving the people of Ontario.
  One of the streams is the Information and Information Technology stream, which seeks to recruit talent in four main areas:
  1. Digital: Transform the way government services are delivered online
  2. Application Development: Develop and support applications
  3. Business Analysis: Define business problems and propose potential technology solutions
  4. Business Intelligence/Data Analytics: Use data to create insights and inform decision making
  We've invited past and current OIP candidates Sharon, Russell and Theo to share their experiences.

ABOUT SPEAKERS
Theo Arbez - UX Design Intern - Ontario Digital Service

I enjoy talking directly to users and considering both the nitty gritty of a design and where it falls in an end-to-end service. In my spare time you can find me playing guitar, working out, or reading.

Sharon Lam, Senior UX Designer at Ontario Digital Service

My cup of tea is listening and analyzing, but when I’m not doing that I like word games and wilderness adventures. And tea.

Russell Christmas, Product Manager Intern at MTO Modernization Solutions / Digital Garage

I aim to look at product design from a holistic organizational perspective, considering business and technical goals and where they align with user-centered design. In my leisure time you'll find me reading, writing, and being way too online.
