  The term ‘climate tech’ can conjure images of breakthroughs to capture carbon from the air or plans to place data centres on the moon in the name of decarbonization.

**Topic:** Working on Environment and Climate Technology

As part of our Climate Theme Month, we invite you to join us for an engaging talk with Dawn Walker.

The term "climate tech" can conjure images of breakthroughs to capture carbon from the air or plans to place data centres on the moon in the name of decarbonization. However, there is a much wider and accessible set of technologies (and projects that use them) to help us navigate the pressing climate crisis. Dawn will discuss her journey working with environment and climate technologies and the different pathways to finding a career or volunteering in this field.

Dawn is a service designer and researcher with eight years experience investigating complex challenges and designing strategies and products to respond. Prior projects have focused on community archives, environmental data stewardship, web platforms, internet infrastructure, and speculative low carbon networking. She completed her PhD at University of Toronto (2022) and currently works for the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy of the Government of BC.
