Topic:

How might we inclusively coordinate, allocate, and plan our economies for mutual prosperity through collective intelligence? Project Maplesync is a platform initiative, inspired by the field of cybernetics, to form indicative plans and other information integration functions at different economic scales and contexts. Maplesync is in its early stages as an open-source project to inspire new thinking on this topic and to generate new experiments in the field, and we are looking for collaborators!

+ Speaker:

Geoffrey Evamy Hill

Geoff is a Master of Design student in the Strategic Foresight and Innovation program at OCAD University. He is a graduate of the Knowledge Integration program at the University Waterloo. His undergraduate thesis was about the economic calculation problem, focused on heuristics for pricing (https://gceh.ca/conference-paper/). This line of inquiry eventually evolved into the thinking behind maplesync.

Prior to maplesync, Geoff founded the Canoe Joint-Canadian Undergraduate Programs project (https://canoejcup.ca/). His other interests include cognitive science, philosophy, computation, and futures. In his spare time, Geoff likes walking, grand strategy video games, making plastic models, and learning Spanish.
