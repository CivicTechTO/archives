topic: Bikespace – Project Updates
description: |-
  BikeSpace is a community-built web app that lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city and helps people find bike parking in Toronto.

  The project originally launched at Civic Tech Toronto in July 2017 and has evolved through several iterations. Hear from some of the current BikeSpace volunteers about what they’ve been working on over the past couple of years, including launching a dashboard and improving it using user testing, and launching a new bike parking map.
