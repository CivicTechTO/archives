date: 2025-10-14
topic: "Sovereign Markets for Any Nation: The Next Step in Digital Public Infrastructure"
description: "Since the 2010s, traditional markets – for labour, finance, goods, services, and content – have been displaced by multinational platforms. Our work focuses on how any government could induce corporates to fund and run a regulated system of markets across their economy, available neutrally to anyone wanting to use it: a new public utility."
