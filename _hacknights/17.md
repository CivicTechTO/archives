The weekly civic tech hacknights are where our diverse community collaborates on technology and design solutions for current civic challenges. Come and be part of it!

Agenda:

6:30-7: Welcome and intros
7-9: Breakout groups (make something!) including Toronto budget workshop

Tonight we're hosting something special, in addition to the regular hacknight breakout groups -- anyone who's interested is invited to participate in a workshop run by the Toronto Budget project team. Workshop info: http://civictech.ca/2015/10/14/help-us-demystify-torontos-budget-on-nov-10/

Toronto Budget workshop participants will:

• Brainstorm what information they need to help them better understand Toronto’s budget process

• Help the team assess the relevance of our existing proposed ideas

• Identify most important ideas to them, for the project team to pursue next
