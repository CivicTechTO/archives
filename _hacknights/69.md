description: |-
  The presenter this week will be Ryan Androsoff, from the Government of Canada's Treasury Board Secretariat. Ryan will present on digital government, and run a special breakout group for further discussion.

  Officials from the Chief Information Officer Branch of the Government of Canada's Treasury Board Secretariat are engaging with stakeholders across Canada on the topic of Digital Government. These discussions are an opportunity to exchange ideas and suggestions to shape a 'made in Canada' approach to digital government as they work to improve how digital services are delivered to citizens. The discussions will touch several major themes, including:

  - Organizing to deliver digital government, and what we can learn from other jurisdictions and organizations

  - Digital talent in government, and how we can bring in world-class digital expertise- Digital service design and delivery, and how to build services from a user-centred perspective

  - Setting the foundations for digital government capacity, building on the federal government's IT Strategic Plan and Cloud Adoption Strategy
