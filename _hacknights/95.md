In order to improve how residents access social assistance, we undertook a comprehensive human-centered process that empowered users of the system to co-develop the modernized access model. Using design thinking, prototyping, and piloting approaches, this unique method to human service redesign was transformative for its learnings and outcomes.

Safiah is a Policy Development Officer for the City of Toronto, interested in the intersections of policy development and ground insights/knowledge for the purposes of poverty reduction.
