description: Civic Tech Toronto's very own Law & Design CoLab are a team of volunteers that works to bring more design thinking and cross-sector collaboration to Ontario's justice sector. The team conceives, scopes, and runs projects in partnership with people and organizations who are working to improve access to justice in Ontario.
