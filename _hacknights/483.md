topic: How can civic tech help improve government service delivery?
description: |-
  For over two decades, civic tech communities across Canada and internationally have been a home for people who want to use digital tools to make government services more accessible, efficient and effective.
  As the Government of Canada grapples with the challenge of hiring and retaining tech talent, some people are asking: should the government be working with more community-led initiatives to help improve digital service delivery?
  Sam Burton, Senior Policy Advisor at the Canadian Digital Service, talks about her recently released report into collaborations between Canadian governments and civic tech volunteers.
