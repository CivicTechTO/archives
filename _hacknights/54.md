The weekly civic tech hacknights bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policymakers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through tech, data, and design. (Coders are welcome, but you don’t have to be a coder to contribute!)

Come and be part of it!
