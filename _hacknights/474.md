topic: "The evolution of retail business: Bloor St (Spadina/Christie)"
description: For the past 30 years, Prof. Martin J. Osborne has conducted an annual survey of street-level businesses on Bloor Street between Spadina and Christie. For each business, he has recorded its name, the type of goods or services it offers, and any ethnic group it specifically targets (if applicable). Prof. Osborne will discuss the nature of this data, which is available at https://mjo.osborne.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/bloor/, and explore it with the audience. The discussion will include potential insights that can be derived from the data and the various applications it might have.
