Civic Tech Montreal aims to solve civic issues with a human centered approach, bringing together technologists, designers, policy nerds, artists, and general members of the community to collaborate and come up with solutions to issues that matter most to them.

We organize hacknights, where participants can pitch their own projects, or collaborate with other community led organizations to help them reach their goals with technology. It’s a great way to contribute to open source projects and to have an impact on your community! Everyone is welcome and tech knowledge is definitely not a requirement.
