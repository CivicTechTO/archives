We're going to the park!

This summer, we're hosting a few in-person park hangouts, on Tuesday evenings:

* July 19: Grange Park (also our 7th anniversary!)
* August 9: Bickford Park
* August 30: Corktown Common

If you feel comfortable doing so, we'd love to see you at the park. You're welcome to bring snacks and drinks for yourself or to share.

If you have trouble finding us, we'll post more specific location info in the \#general channel on Slack. Or call or text 647-222-6677.

Finally, if you're experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, please don't come out -- we hope to see you at the next one!
