Speakers:
Stephanie has been active in the co-operative sector for 15 years, serving as Vice-President of Canada's apex association (Co-operatives and Mutuals Canada, 2019-2021) and representing it on the board of Cooperativas Americas. As a co-operative developer, she is dedicated to leveraging the co-operative business model to restore worker dignity and agency. She has been on the development team of a number of platform co-operatives, including Up & Go in NYC, and collaborated with SMart Belgium to duplicate the model in Quebec. She is also dedicated to ensuring the cooperative business model remains relevant in a changing world of work, and has collaborated with partners in Quebec to review legislation, securities law and strengthen ecosystems to receive next generation, digital-first co-ops.
