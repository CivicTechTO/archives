– Naoufel Testaouni, President, QueerTech

Naoufel started his career in the non-profit sector as General Manager for AIESEC in Morocco, which provides young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internships. He later transferred to the AIESEC United States in New York City and managed the expansion to Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE.

Naoufel joined Microsoft Middle East and Africa as Regional Program Coordinator, managing the Microsoft Software Donation Program for internet safety and security and relationships with crucial Microsoft partners in the region. After two years at Microsoft, Naoufel moved to Montreal to join tech startup TandemLaunch Technologies, where he built relationships with university tech transfer offices around the world.

Today, Naoufel is the co-founder and President of QueerTech, an organization that empowers LGBTQ2S+ in the tech industry. He is also Head of Business Development at Local Logic. In his role, he focuses on market expansion and client acquisition in the US and Canada.

Andy Saldaña is the Executive Director of NY Tech Alliance, a non-profit organization that runs the largest Meetup group in the world, the NY Tech Meetup (NYTM). With over 60,000 members and a mission to build a more sustainable, diverse, and equitable technology industry for all New Yorkers, the organization sits at the center of the NY Tech ecosystem.

He is also a co-founder of QueerTech, a non-profit based in Montreal focused on empowering, connecting, and increasing the visibility of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs and technologists.

Most recently, Andy was named to Crain’s New York Business 2020 Notable LGBTQ Leaders and Executives list.

He is a strong advocate for increased diversity, access, and all-around inclusion in tech, but above all, he enjoys cultivating connections and all of the conversations that evolve.
